<p><strong>Network Contagion and Interbank Amplification during the Great Depression</strong></p>
<p>Kris James Mitchener&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gary Richardson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interbank networks amplified the contraction in lending during the Great Depression. Panics induced banks in the hinterland to withdraw interbank deposits from Federal Reserve member banks located in reserve and central reserve cities. These correspondent banks responded by curtailing lending to businesses. Between the peak in the summer of 1929 and the banking holiday in the winter of 1933, interbank amplification reduced aggregate commercial bank lending by an estimated 15 percent.</p>

<p><strong>Internalizing Global Value Chains: A Firm-Level Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Laura Alfaro&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pol Antràs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davin Chor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paola Conconi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key decision facing firms is the extent of control to exert over the different stages in their production processes. We develop and test a property rights model of firm boundary choices along the value chain. We construct firm-level measures of the upstreamness of integrated and nonintegrated inputs by combining information on firms’ production activities in more than 100 countries with input-output tables. Whether a firm integrates upstream or downstream suppliers depends crucially on the elasticity of demand it faces. Moreover, integration is shaped by the relative contractibility of stages along the value chain, as well as by the firm’s productivity.</p>

<p><strong>Land Reform and Sex Selection in China</strong></p>
<p>Douglas Almond&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hongbin Li&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuang Zhang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China’s land reform in 1978–84 unleashed rapid growth in farm output and household income. In new data on reform timing in 914 counties, we find an immediate trend break in the fraction of male children following the reform. Among second births that followed a firstborn girl, sex ratios increased from 1.1 to 1.3 boys per girl in the 4 years following reform. Larger increases are found among families with more education. The land reform estimate is robust to controlling for the county-level rollout of the One Child Policy. Overall, we estimate land reform accounted for about 1 million missing girls.</p>

<p><strong>Watersheds in Child Mortality: The Role of Effective Water and Sewerage Infrastructure, 1880–1920</strong></p>
<p>Marcella Alsan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claudia Goldin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We explore the first period of sustained decline in child mortality in the United States and provide estimates of the independent and combined effects of clean water and effective sewerage systems on under-5 mortality. Our case is Massachusetts, 1880–1920, when authorities developed a sewerage and water district in the Boston area. We find the two interventions were complementary and together account for approximately one-third of the decline in log child mortality during the 41 years. Our findings are relevant to the developing world and suggest that a piecemeal approach to infrastructure investments is unlikely to significantly improve child health.</p>

<p><strong>Production Networks, Geography, and Firm Performance</strong></p>
<p>Andrew B. Bernard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreas Moxnes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yukiko U. Saito&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper examines the importance of buyer-supplier relationships for firm performance. We develop a model in which firms outsource tasks and search for suppliers. Lower search and outsourcing costs lead firms to search more and find better suppliers, which in turn drives down marginal costs. We test the theory by exploiting the opening of a high-speed train line in Japan, which lowered the cost of passenger travel but left shipping costs unchanged. Using an exhaustive data set on firms’ buyer-seller linkages, we find significant improvements in firm performance as well as creation of buyer-seller links, consistent with the model.</p>

<p><strong>Counterparty Risk and the Establishment of the New York Stock Exchange Clearinghouse</strong></p>
<p>Asaf Bernstein&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric Hughson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marc Weidenmier&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We examine the effect of the establishment of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) clearinghouse in 1892 on counterparty risk using a novel historical experiment. During this period, the NYSE stocks were dual-listed on the Consolidated Stock Exchange (CSE), which already had a clearinghouse. Using identical securities on the CSE as a control, we find that the introduction of multilateral net settlement through a clearinghouse substantially reduced volatility of NYSE returns caused by settlement risk and increased asset values. Our results indicate that a clearinghouse can improve market stability and value through a reduction in network contagion and counterparty risk.</p>

<p><strong>A Network Approach to Public Goods</strong></p>
<p>Matthew Elliott&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin Golub&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose that agents can exert costly effort that creates nonrival, heterogeneous benefits for each other. At each possible outcome, a weighted, directed network describing marginal externalities is defined. We show that Pareto efficient outcomes are those at which the largest eigenvalue of the network is 1. An important set of efficient solutions--Lindahl outcomes--are characterized by contributions being proportional to agents' eigenvector centralities in the network. The outcomes we focus on are motivated by negotiations. We apply the results to identify who is essential for Pareto improvements, how to efficiently subdivide negotiations, and whom to optimally add to a team.</p>

<p><strong>The Friendship Paradox and Systematic Biases in Perceptions and Social Norms</strong></p>
<p>Matthew O. Jackson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “friendship paradox” (first noted by Feld in 1991) refers to the fact that, on average, people have strictly fewer friends than their friends have. I show that this oversampling of more popular people can lead people to perceive more engagement than exists in the overall population. This feeds back to amplify engagement in behaviors that involve complementarities. Also, people with the greatest proclivity for a behavior choose to interact the most, leading to further feedback and amplification. These results are consistent with studies finding overestimation of peer consumption of alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs and with resulting high levels of drug and alcohol consumption.</p>

<p><strong>Research Proximity and Productivity: Long-Term Evidence from Agriculture</strong></p>
<p>Shawn Kantor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander Whalley&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use the late nineteenth-century establishment of agricultural experiment stations at preexisting land-grant colleges across the United States to estimate the importance of proximity to research for productivity growth. Our analysis reveals that proximity to newly opened permanent stations affected land productivity for about 20 years and then subsequently declined until becoming largely absent today. We conclude that spatial frictions substantially reduced the rate of return to public research spending in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but such frictions significantly diminished as extension programs, automobiles, and telephones made it easier for discoveries to reach farther farms.</p>

<p><strong>On the Intergenerational Transmission of Economic Status</strong></p>
<p>Sang Yoon (Tim) Lee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ananth Seshadri&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We present a model in which human capital investments occur over the life cycle and across generations, à la Becker and Tomes. The human capital technology features multiple stages of childhood investments, college, and life cycle accumulation. The model can explain a wide range of intergenerational relationships while remaining empirically consistent with cross-sectional inequality. Much of the latter is determined by early investments in children, so that borrowing constraints faced by young parents are important for understanding the persistence of economic status across generations. Education subsidies, especially early on, can significantly reduce the intergenerational persistence of economic status.</p>

<p><strong>Is It Harder for Older Workers to Find Jobs? New and Improved Evidence from a Field Experiment</strong></p>
<p>David Neumark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian Burn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick Button&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We design and implement a large-scale resume correspondence study to address limitations of existing field experiments testing for age discrimination that may bias their results. One limitation that may bias results is giving older and younger applicants similar experience to make them “otherwise comparable.” A second limitation is that greater unobserved differences in human capital investment of older applicants may bias the results against finding age discrimination. On the basis of over 40,000 job applications, we find robust evidence of age discrimination in hiring against older women, especially those near retirement age, but considerably less evidence of age discrimination against men.</p>
