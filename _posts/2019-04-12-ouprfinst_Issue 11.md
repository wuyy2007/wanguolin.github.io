<p><strong>Strategic News Releases in Equity Vesting Months</strong></p>
<p>Alex Edmans&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luis Goncalves-Pinto&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moqi Groen-Xu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yanbo Wang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find that CEOs release 20% more discretionary news items in months in which they are expected to sell equity, predicted using scheduled vesting months. These vesting months are determined by equity grants made several years prior and thus unlikely to be driven by the current information environment. The increase arises for positive news, but not neutral or negative news, nor nondiscretionary news. News releases fall in the month before and month after the vesting month. News in vesting months generates a temporary increase in stock prices and market liquidity, which the CEO exploits by cashing out shortly afterwards.Received August 29, 2014; editorial decision March 20, 2018 by Editor Laura Starks.

<p><strong>The Retention Effects of Unvested Equity: Evidence from Accelerated Option Vesting</strong></p>
<p>Torsten Jochem&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomislav Ladika&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zacharias Sautner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We document that firms can effectively retain executives by granting deferred equity pay. We show this by analyzing a unique regulatory change (FAS 123-R) that prompted 723 firms to suddenly eliminate stock option vesting periods. This allowed CEOs to keep 33% more options when departing the firm, and we find that voluntary CEO departure rates subsequently rose from 5% to 21%. Our identification strategy exploits FAS 123-R’s almost-random timing, which was staggered by firms’ fiscal year-ends. Firms that experienced departures suffered negative stock price reactions, and responded by increasing compensation for remaining and newly hired executives.Received June 6, 2016; editorial decision October 10, 2017 by Editor Andrew Karolyi.

<p><strong>Product Market Competition Shocks, Firm Performance, and Forced CEO Turnover</strong></p>
<p>Sudipto Dasgupta&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xi Li&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert Y Wang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We examine the effect of competition shocks induced by major industry-level tariff cuts on forced CEO turnover. Both the likelihood of forced CEO turnover and its sensitivity to performance increase. These effects are stronger for firms exposed to greater predation risk and with products more similar to those of other firms. CEOs are more likely to be forced out in weak governance firms; however, in good governance firms, CEOs are offered higher incentive pay. New outside CEOs receive higher incentive pay and come from firms with lower cost structures and higher asset sales. Performance and productivity improve after forced turnover.Received November 27, 2014; editorial decision July 18, 2017 by Editor David Denis.

<p><strong>Agency Conflicts around the World</strong></p>
<p>Erwan Morellec&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boris Nikolov&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman Schürhoff&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman Schuerhoff&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We construct firm-level indexes for agency conflicts between controlling shareholders and outside investors by estimating a dynamic model of financing decisions. Our estimates for 12,652 firms from 14 countries show that agency conflicts are large and highly variable across firms and countries. Differences in agency conflicts are largely due to differences in firm-level governance, ownership concentration, and other firm characteristics. The origin of law is more relevant for curtailing governance excesses than for guarding the typical firm. Agency costs split about equally between wealth transfers and value losses from policy distortions. Recent governance reforms in Europe have significantly reduced agency costs.Received April 19, 2016; editorial decision November 18, 2017 by Received April 19, 2016; editorial decision November 18, 2017 by Editor Francesca Cornelli.

<p><strong>The Evolution of Corporate Cash</strong></p>
<p>John R Graham&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark T Leary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We study time-series and cross-firm variation in corporate cash holdings from 1920 to 2014. The recent increase in cash is not unique in magnitude. However, the recent divergence between average and aggregate cash is new and entirely driven by a shift in cash policies of newly public firms, whereas within-firm changes have been negative or flat since the 1940s. Cross-sectional relations between cash holdings and firm characteristics are stable throughout the century, though characteristics explain little of the trends in aggregate cash. Macroeconomic conditions, corporate profitability and investment, and (since 2000) repatriation taxes explain aggregate cash over the last century.Received August 23, 2017; editorial decision April 28, 2018 by Editor Andrew Karolyi.</p>

<p><strong>Extrapolation Bias and the Predictability of Stock Returns by Price-Scaled Variables</strong></p>
<p>Stefano Cassella&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huseyin Gulen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using survey data on expectations of stock returns, we recursively estimate the degree of extrapolative weighting in investors’ beliefs (DOX). In an extrapolation framework, DOX determines the relative weight investors place on recent-versus-distant returns. DOX varies considerably over time. The ability of price-scaled variables to predict the year-ahead equity premium is contingent on DOX. High price-scaled variables are followed by lower returns only when DOX is high. Our findings support extrapolation-based theories of the stock market and the interpretation of price-scaled variables as mispricing proxies. Our results help answer a critical question: when will an overvalued asset experience a correction?Received December 5, 2015; editorial decision June 22, 2017 by Editor Robin Greenwood.

<p><strong>The Liquid Hand-to-Mouth: Evidence from Personal Finance Management Software</strong></p>
<p>Arna Olafsson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michaela Pagel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use a very accurate panel of all individual spending, income, balances, and credit limits from a personal finance software to document spending responses to the arrival of both regular and irregular income. These payday responses are robust and homogeneous for all income and spending categories throughout the income distribution. Moreover, we find that few people hold little or no liquidity. We then analyze whether people hold liquidity cushions to cope with future liquidity constraints. However, we find that peoples’ responses are consistent with standard models without illiquid savings, in which neither present nor future liquidity constraints are frequently binding.Received May 31, 2016; editorial decision September 30, 2017 by Editor Itay Goldstein.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Advice and Bank Profits</strong></p>
<p>Daniel Hoechle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan Ruenzi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nic Schaub&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markus Schmid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use a unique data set from a large retail bank containing internal managerial accounting data on revenues and costs per client to analyze how banks and their financial advisors generate profits with customers. We find that advised transactions are associated with higher profits than independently executed trades of the same client. The bank’s own mutual funds and structured products are most profitable for the bank, and profits increase with trade size. We show that advisors recommend exactly those transactions. Furthermore, we find that advised clients achieve a worse performance than independent clients, suggesting that advisors put their employer’s interest first.Received April 21, 2016; editorial decision January 24, 2018 by Editor Itay Goldstein.

<p><strong>Debt Priority Structure, Market Discipline, and Bank Conduct</strong></p>
<p>Piotr Danisewicz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny McGowan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enrico Onali&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus Schaeck&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We examine how debt priority structure affects bank funding costs and soundness. Leveraging an unexplored natural experiment that changes the priority of claims on banks’ assets, we document asymmetric effects that are consistent with changes in monitoring intensity by various creditors depending on whether creditors move up or down the priority ladder. The enactment of depositor preference laws that confer priority on depositors reduces deposit rates but increases nondeposit rates. Importantly, subordinating nondepositor claims reduces bank risk-taking, consistent with market discipline. This insight highlights a role for debt priority structure in the regulatory framework.Received September 1, 2016; editorial decision August 31, 2017 by Editor Philip Strahan.

<p><strong>Contagious Effects of a Political Intervention in Debt Contracts: Evidence Using Loan-Level Data</strong></p>
<p>Prasanna L Tantri&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using an unexpected government regulation that restricted the ability of microfinance institutions to recover loans in one Indian state, I examine whether this intervention affected bank loan performance. The bank loan delinquency rate significantly increased as a result. In response, the ex post bank credit supply declined by more than half. For identification, I compare loans from branches located in regions subject to this intervention with loans from nearby branches of the same bank located in regions not subject to the intervention. I conclude that political interventions in credit markets could have significant spillover effects.Received October 29, 2016; editorial decision November 28, 2017 by Editor Philip Strahan.
