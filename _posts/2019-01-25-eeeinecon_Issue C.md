<p><strong>A structural model of productivity, uncertain demand, and export dynamics</strong></p>
<p>Shengyu Li&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper develops and estimates a dynamic model of exporting to quantify how productivity and uncertain foreign demand separately influence firms' export participation. In this model, firms face uncertainty about their own foreign demand, and they update their beliefs based on individual export transactions according to Bayes' rule. I estimate the model using data on firm-level production and transaction-level exports to Germany in the Chinese ceramics and glass industry. The empirical results show substantial heterogeneity in productivity and demand belief. For experienced firms, productivity is the major driving force of export participation. In contrast, for potential entrants, demand learning plays a more important role. A counterfactual exercise suggests that trade cost reduction has a significant impact on stimulating the export participation of potential entrants. Importantly, more than half of the participation increase is attributed to firms' endogenous reaction to demand learning in the foreign market.</p>

<p><strong>Beggar thy neighbor or beggar thy domestic firms? Evidence from 2000 to 2011 Chinese customs data</strong></p>
<p>Rasmus Fatum&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Runjuan Liu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiadong Tong&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiayun Xu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A premise of beggar-thy-neighbor policies is that currency depreciations lead to export growth. This premise, however, does not seem validated as there is no consensus in the empirical literature regarding the impact of exchange rate changes on trade flows. We reexamine whether currency fluctuations are systematically associated with trade flows using a rich and unique Chinese customs dataset spanning the universe of bilateral Chinese transaction level trades over the 2000 to 2011 period. This dataset allows us to consider firm-level involvement in processing trade and firm-level dynamics in both export and import markets. Key findings of our firm-level estimations of trade elasticities include that the response of Chinese firms to exchanges rate changes depends strongly on the extent to which firms are involved in processing trade, i.e. heterogeneity in the extent of processing trade is crucial to understanding trade elasticities, and that the Chinese trade balance responds strongly to changes in the relative value of the Chinese Yuan, thereby implying that the influence of exchange rates on trade flows is significant and that currency depreciations do in fact lead to export growth and trade balance improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Bank linkages and international trade</strong></p>
<p>Julian Caballero&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher Candelaria&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galina Hale&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We uncover a new channel through which international finance is related to trade: the formation of international bank linkages increases exports. Bank linkages are measured for each pair of countries in each year as a number of bank pairs in these two countries that are connected through cross-border syndicated lending. Using a gravity approach to model trade for 66 countries over 24 years with a full set of fixed effects (source-year, target-year, source-target), we find that new connections between banks in a given country-pair lead to an increase in trade flows between these countries in the following year and to trade diversions from countries competing for similar imports. We conjecture that the mechanism for this effect is the role bank linkages play in reducing export risk and present evidence supporting this conjecture. In particular, using industry-level trade data and controlling for country-pair-year and industry fixed effects, we find that new bank linkages have larger impacts on trade in industries which tend to be subject to more export risk. For U.S. banks, we can show that bank linkages are positively associated with foreign letter of credit exposures.</p>

<p><strong>Domestic and multilateral effects of capital controls in emerging markets</strong></p>
<p>Gurnain Kaur Pasricha&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matteo Falagiarda&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin Bijsterbosch&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua Aizenman&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a novel, high frequency dataset on capital control actions in 16 emerging market economies (EMEs) from 2001 to 2012, we provide new evidence on the domestic and multilateral effects of capital controls. Increases in capital account openness reduce monetary policy autonomy and increase exchange rate stability, confirming the constraints of the monetary policy trilemma. Both gross in- and outflows rise, while the effect on net capital flows is ambiguous. Tighter capital inflow restrictions generated significant spillovers, especially in the post-2008 environment of abundant global liquidity. We also find evidence of a domestic policy response to foreign capital control changes in countries that are affected by these spillovers.</p>

<p><strong>Exchange rates, cross-border travel, and retailers: Theory and empirics</strong></p>
<p>Jen Baggs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loretta Fung&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beverly Lapham&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the effects of nominal exchange rate movements on retail firms' sales, emphasizing the role of cross-border travel by consumers. We develop a search-theoretic model of price-setting heterogeneous retailers and traveling consumers who face nominal exchange rate shocks. These shocks affect retailers on the supply side, through imported input prices, and on the demand side, via their effect on the propensity for consumers to cross the border and shop at foreign retail stores. We use Canadian retailer and traveler data from 1986 to 2007 to estimate the model. Consistent with the model, the empirical results indicate that an appreciation of the Canadian dollar substantially increases Canadians' cross border travel which has a significant negative effect on the sales of Canadian retailers. These effects diminish with the distance to the nearest US shopping destination, relative population and the median income of the community in which the retailer operates. Using counterfactual experiments, we quantify the positive effects on Canadian retailers' sales of more restrictive border controls after September 2001, and the negative effects on those sales of increased Canadian duty free allowances and the expansion of US shopping opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Fiscal policy coordination in currency unions at the effective lower bound</strong></p>
<p>Thomas Hettig&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gernot J. Müller&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the pre-crises consensus there are separate domains for monetary and fiscal stabilization in a currency union. While the common monetary policy takes care of union-wide fluctuations, fiscal policies should be tailored to meet country-specific conditions. This separation is no longer optimal, however, if monetary policy is constrained by an effective lower bound on interest rates. Specifically, we show that in this case there are benefits from coordinating fiscal policies across countries. By coordinating fiscal policies, policymakers are better able to stabilize union-wide activity and inflation while avoiding detrimental movements of a country's terms of trade.</p>

<p><strong>International trade and retail market performance and structure: Theory and empirical evidence</strong></p>
<p>Philipp Meinen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horst Raff&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use Danish microdata for the period 1999 to 2008 to examine how greater consumer goods imports affect retail market performance and structure. Based on a propensity score matching approach, we estimate that retailers that start to import have 8% greater sales, 6% greater profits, and 2% greater markups in the year of import initiation compared to non-importing retailers. These differences are quite persistent. For instance, we estimate that cumulative sales of import starters are up to 30% higher on average after three years than for comparable non-importers. We also find that imports are associated with a higher exit probability of small retailers and greater local retail market concentration. We argue that the observed adjustments may imply additional gains from trade absent from models lacking a distribution sector.</p>

<p><strong>The international elasticity puzzle is worse than you think</strong></p>
<p>Lionel Fontagné&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philippe Martin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gianluca Orefice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We instrument export prices with firm level electricity cost shocks and estimate three international price elasticities using firm-level export data: the elasticity of firm exports to export price, tariff and real exchange rate shocks. In standard models these three elasticities should be equal. We find that this is far from being the case. The export price elasticity is the highest, around 5, much larger than the exchange rate elasticity. The international elasticity puzzle is therefore worse than previously thought. We also show that exporters absorb one third of tariff changes in their export prices. Because we take into account this reaction of export prices to tariffs, our estimate of the tariff elasticity corrects from this omitted-variable bias.</p>

<p><strong>Where is the value added? Trade liberalization and production networks</strong></p>
<p>Rahel Aichele&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inga Heiland&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what extent has trade liberalization contributed to global and regional production fragmentation and the formation of production networks? We derive structural equations for value added trade flows, the domestic value added content of exports (DVA) and the value added to exports (VAX) ratio, as well as model-based measures for production networks from a multi-sector gravity model with inter-sectoral linkages. We calibrate the model and perform a counterfactual analysis of China's WTO accession in 2001. We find that the associated trade cost changes spurred global production fragmentation, explaining about 6–12% of the decrease in the world DVA ratio as observed between 2000 and 2007. For China, the counterfactual experiment robustly replicates the increase in its DVA ratio, driven by the export-processing zones. Furthermore, our results imply that China's WTO accession was a driving force behind the strengthening of production networks with its neighbors.</p>

<p><strong>Uncertainty, risk aversion and international trade</strong></p>
<p>Antoine Gervais&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this paper, I study the impact of uncertainty in the delivery of inputs on international trade patterns. I develop a model of sourcing decisions where risk-averse managers can contract with multiple suppliers in order to decrease the variability of firm profits. Among other results, the model predicts that firms will buy a larger share of their inputs from low price variability suppliers, and that the distribution of input demand across suppliers will be more dispersed in input markets characterized with high price variability. Econometric evidence suggests that the model is consistent with qualitative features of the data.</p>

<p><strong>Ramsey-optimal tax reforms and real exchange rate dynamics</strong></p>
<p>Stéphane Auray&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurélien Eyquem&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Gomme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We solve the Ramsey-optimal tax plan for a small open economy with an endogenously-determined real exchange rate. The open economy constrains the government's setting of the capital income tax rate since physical capital cannot be dominated in rate of return by foreign assets. However, the endogenous real exchange rate loosens this constraint relative to a one good open economy model in which the real exchange rate is necessarily fixed. We find that the dynamics of the two good small open economy model more closely resemble those of a closed economy model than a one good small open economy model.</p>

<p><strong>Commodity prices and labour market dynamics in small open economies</strong></p>
<p>Martin Bodenstein&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gunes Kamber&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christoph Thoenissen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We show that a model of an advanced small open economy with exports in commodities and search and matching frictions in the labour market can match the impulse responses from a panel vector autoregression to an identified commodity price shock. Using a minimum distance strategy, we find that international financial risk sharing is low even for advanced small open economies. Moreover, a strong real exchange rate appreciation is key for an unexpected commodity price increase to induce a tightening of labour market conditions in the model that is in line with the empirical evidence. As in the case of technology shocks discussed by Shimer (2005), proper amplification of the commodity price shock requires a high value of the outside option for unemployed agents. However, vacancies and unemployment hardly respond whenever the real exchange rate channel is mute. These findings suggest the relevance of the open economy dimension for the transmission of demand-type shocks to the labour market more generally.</p>

<p><strong>Redistributing the gains from trade through progressive taxation</strong></p>
<p>Spencer G. Lyon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael E. Waugh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a nation's tax system become more progressive as it opens to trade? Does opening to trade change the benefits of a progressive tax system? We answer these question within a standard incomplete markets model with frictional labor markets and Ricardian trade. Consistent with empirical evidence, adverse shocks to comparative advantage lead to labor income losses for import-competition-exposed workers; with incomplete markets, these workers are imperfectly insured and experience welfare losses. A progressive tax system is valuable, as it substitutes for imperfect insurance and redistributes the gains from trade. However, it also reduces the incentives for labor to reallocate away from comparatively disadvantaged locations. We find that optimal progressivity should increase with openness to trade with a ten percentage point increase in openness necessitating a five percentage point increase in marginal tax rates for those at the top of the income distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Investment responses to trade liberalization: Evidence from U.S. industries and establishments</strong></p>
<p>Justin R. Pierce&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter K. Schott&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We examine the impact of trade liberalization on domestic investment in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we find that industries more exposed to an increase in import competition exhibit relative declines in investment. We find that establishment exit plays a key role in the investment adjustment, and that, along the intensive margin, the decline in investment is concentrated among establishments with low initial levels of labor productivity, capital intensity and skill intensity. Analysis of investment patterns before and after the liberalization suggests that, for certain establishments, investment activity is less lumpy following the policy change.</p>

<p><strong>Global value chains and inequality with endogenous labor supply</strong></p>
<p>Eunhee Lee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kei-Mu Yi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We assess the role of global value chains in transmitting global integration shocks to aggregate trade as well as distributional outcomes. We develop a multi-country general equilibrium trade model that features multi-stage production, with different stages having different productivities and using factors (occupations) with different intensities. The model also features a Roy mechanism, in which heterogeneous workers endogenously choose their sector and occupation. Country- and worker-level comparative advantages interact. A reduction in trade costs leads to countries specializing in their comparative advantage sectors and production stages. This specialization changes labor demand and also leads to more workers shifting to their comparative advantage sectors and occupations. We calibrate our model to the U.S., China, and the rest of the world in 2000 and we simulate a decline in China's trade costs with the U.S., designed to mimic China's entry into the WTO. Our simulation results imply an increase in the skill premium in both the U.S. and China, and the GVC,i.e., specialization across stages, is critical to this outcome.</p>

<p><strong>Learning to import from your peers</strong></p>
<p>Márta Bisztray&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miklós Koren&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam Szeidl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use firm-level data from Hungary to estimate knowledge spillovers in importing through fine spatial and managerial networks. By identifying from variation in peers' import experience across source countries, by comparing the spillover from neighboring buildings with a cross-street placebo, and by exploiting plausibly exogenous firm moves, we obtain credible estimates and establish three results. (1) There are significant knowledge spillovers in both spatial and managerial networks. Having a peer which has imported from a particular country more than doubles the probability of starting to import from that country, but the effect quickly decays with distance. (2) Spillovers are heterogeneous: they are stronger when firms or peers are larger or more productive, and exhibit complementarities in firm and peer productivity. (3) The model-implied social multiplier is highly skewed, implying that targeting an import-encouragement policy to firms with many and productive neighbors can make it 26% more effective. These results highlight the benefit of firm clusters in facilitating the diffusion of business practices.</p>

<p><strong>Peeling away the layers: Impacts of durable tariff elimination</strong></p>
<p>Gnutzmann-Mkrtchyan, Arevik&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christian Henn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We demonstrate that durable MFN tariff elimination affects trade patterns through several layers, and magnitudes of effects are sizable. The WTO Information Technology Agreement's (ITA) unique setting allows us to overcome the challenges associated with identifying effects of non-discriminatory trade policies due to two reasons: (i) ITA constitutes a quasi-natural experiment of several “passive” signatories joining the agreement as an unavoidable part of pursuing a larger policy objective, and (ii) ITA's partial coverage of the IT sector provides a natural control group for identification based on cross-product variation. Our analysis finds novel nonlinear impacts of tariff liberalization: Complete tariff elimination results in large additional trade gains – over and above tariff reductions – especially for intermediate goods. The commitment to durable tariff elimination, through WTO bindings, adds another two layers, boosting both imports and exports more than equivalent unilateral reforms. This commitment spurned development of a downstream IT export sector in “passive” signatories.</p>
