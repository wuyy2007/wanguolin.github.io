<p><strong>Children, Unhappiness and Family Finances: Evidence from One Million Europeans</strong></p>
<p>David G. Blanchflower&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew E. Clark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The common finding of a zero or negative correlation between the presence of children and parental well-being continues to generate research interest. We here consider over one million observations on Europeans from ten years of Eurobarometer surveys, and in the first instance replicate this negative finding, both in the overall data and then for most different marital statuses. Children are expensive, and controlling for financial difficulties turns almost all of our estimated child coefficients positive. We argue that financial difficulties explain the pattern of existing results by parental education and income, and country income and social support. Marital status matters. Kids do not raise happiness for singles, the divorced, separated or widowed. Last, we underline that all children are not the same, with step-children commonly having a more negative correlation than children from the current relationship.

<p><strong>Actors in the Child Development Process</strong></p>
<p>Daniela Del Boca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher J. Flinn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ewout Verriest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew J. Wiswall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We construct and estimate a model of child development in which both the parents and children make investments in the child’s skill development. In each period of the development process, partially altruistic parents act as the Stackelberg leader and the child the follower when setting her own study time. We then extend this non-cooperative form of interaction by allowing parents to offer incentives to the child to increase her study time, at some monitoring cost. We show that this incentive scheme, a kind of internal conditional cash transfer, produces efficient outcomes and, in general, increases the child’s cognitive ability. In addition to heterogeneity in resources (wage offers and non-labor income), the model allows for heterogeneity in preferences both for parents and children, and in monitoring costs. Like their parents, children are forward-looking, but we allow children and parents to have different preferences and for children to have age-varying discount rates, becoming more “patient” as they age. Using detailed time diary information on the allocation of parent and child time linked to measures of child cognitive ability, we estimate several versions of the model. Using model estimates, we explore the impact of various government income transfer policies on child development.

<p><strong>On the Economics of Science Parks</strong></p>
<p>Wen-Jung Liang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chao-Cheng Mai&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques-François Thisse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ping Wang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Science parks play a growing in knowledge-based economies by accommodating high-tech firms and providing an environment that fosters location-dependent knowledge spillovers and promote R&D investments by firms. Yet, not much is known about the economic conditions under which such entities may form in equilibrium without government interventions. This paper develops a spatial equilibrium model with a competitive final sector and a monopolistic competitive intermediate sector, which allows us to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a science park to emerge as an equilibrium outcome. We show that strong localized knowledge spillovers, high startup costs, skilled labor abundance, or low commuting costs make intermediate firms more likely to cluster and a science park more likely to form. We also show that the productivity of the final sector is highest when intermediate firms cluster. As the decay penalty, firms' startup and workers' commuting costs become lower, science parks will eventually be fragmented.

<p><strong>The Effect of Pollution and Heat on High Skill Public Sector Worker Productivity in China</strong></p>
<p>Matthew E. Kahn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pei Li&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The quality of governance depends on public sector worker productivity. We use micro data from China to document that judges are less productive on polluted days. Building on the insights of Alchian and Kessel (1962), we discuss the role of organization design and the incentives of public versus for profit organizations in designing a workplace that reduces the productivity costs of local disamenities. We find that the public sector productivity elasticities are larger than published estimates of the private sector productivity elasticities with respect to pollution.

<p><strong>Best Linear Approximations to Set Identified Functions: With an Application to the Gender Wage Gap</strong></p>
<p>Arun G. Chandrasekhar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor Chernozhukov&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francesca Molinari&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Schrimpf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This paper provides inference methods for best linear approximations to functions which are known to lie within a band. It extends the partial identification literature by allowing the upper and lower functions defining the band to carry an index, and to be unknown but parametrically or non-parametrically estimable functions. The identification region of the parameters of the best linear approximation is characterized via its support function, and limit theory is developed for the latter. We prove that the support function can be approximated by a Gaussian process and establish validity of the Bayesian bootstrap for inference. Because the bounds may carry an index, the approach covers many canonical examples in the partial identification literature arising in the presence of interval valued outcome and/or regressor data: not only mean regression, but also quantile and distribution regression, including sample selection problems, as well as mean, quantile, and distribution treatment effects. In addition, the framework can account for the availability of instruments. An application is carried out, studying female labor force participation using data from Mulligan and Rubinstein (2008) and insights from Blundell, Gosling, Ichimura, and Meghir (2007). Our results yield robust evidence of a gender wage gap, both in the 1970s and 1990s, at quantiles of the wage distribution up to the 0.4, while allowing for completely unrestricted selection into the labor force. Under the assumption that the median wage offer of the employed is larger than that of individuals that do not work, the evidence of a gender wage gap extends to quantiles up to the 0.7. When the assumption is further strengthened to require stochastic dominance, the evidence of a gender wage gap extends to all quantiles, and there is some evidence at the 0.8 and higher quantiles that the gender wage gap decreased between the 1970s and 1990s.

<p><strong>Decentralized Mining in Centralized Pools</strong></p>
<p>Lin William Cong&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhiguo He&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiasun Li&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The rise of centralized mining pools for risk sharing does not necessarily undermine the decentralization required for public blockchains. However, mining pools as a financial innovation significantly escalates the arms race among competing miners and thus increases the energy consumption of proof-of-work-based blockchains. Each individual miner's cross-pool diversification and endogenous fees charged by pools generally sustain decentralization --- larger pools better internalize their externality on global hash rates, charge higher fees, attract disproportionately fewer miners, and thus grow slower. Empirical evidence from Bitcoin mining supports our model predictions, and the economic insights apply to many other blockchain protocols, as well as mainstream industries with similar characteristics.

<p><strong>Are Consumers Attentive to Local Energy Costs? Evidence from the Appliance Market</strong></p>
<p>Sébastien Houde&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erica Myers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We estimate whether consumers respond to local energy costs when purchasing appliances.  Using a dataset from an appliance retailer, we compare demand responsiveness to a measure of energy costs that varies with local energy prices versus purchase prices.  We strongly reject that consumers are unresponsive to local energy costs under a wide range of assumptions.  These findings run counter to the popular wisdom, which motivates energy standards, that energy costs are a shrouded attribute.  Capital investments are an important channel for electricity demand response and may explain some of the large differences between short and long run electricity price elasticities.

<p><strong>Toward an Understanding of the Development of Time Preferences: Evidence from Field Experiments</strong></p>
<p>James Andreoni&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael A. Kuhn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John A. List&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anya Samek&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin Sokal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Sprenger&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Time preferences have been correlated with a range of life outcomes, yet little is known about their early development. We conduct a field experiment to elicit time preferences of over 1,200 children ages 3-12, who make several intertemporal decisions. To shed light on how such primitives form, we explore various channels that might affect time preferences, from background characteristics to the causal impact of an early schooling program that we developed and operated. Our results suggest that time preferences evolve substantially during this period, with younger children displaying more impatience than older children. We also find a strong association with race: black children, relative to white or Hispanic children, are more impatient. Finally, assignment to different schooling opportunities is not significantly associated with child time preferences.

<p><strong>When Celebrities Speak: A Nationwide Twitter Experiment Promoting Vaccination In Indonesia</strong></p>
<p>Vivi Alatas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arun G. Chandrasekhar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markus Mobius&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin A. Olken&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cindy Paladines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Celebrity endorsements are often sought to influence public opinion. We ask whether celebrity endorsement per se has an effect beyond the fact that their statements are seen by many, and whether on net their statements actually lead people to change their beliefs. To do so, we conducted a nationwide Twitter experiment in Indonesia with 46 high-profile celebrities and organizations, with a total of 7.8 million followers, who agreed to let us randomly tweet or retweet content promoting immunization from their accounts. Our design exploits the structure of what information is passed on along a retweet chain on Twitter to parse reach versus endorsement effects. Endorsements matter: tweets that users can identify as being originated by a celebrity are far more likely to be liked or retweeted by users than similar tweets seen by the same users but without the celebrities' imprimatur. By contrast, explicitly citing sources in the tweets actually reduces diffusion. By randomizing which celebrities tweeted when, we find suggestive evidence that overall exposure to the campaign may influence beliefs about vaccination and knowledge of immunization-seeking behavior by one's network. Taken together, the findings suggest an important role for celebrity endorsement.

<p><strong>Work of the Past, Work of the Future</strong></p>
<p>David Autor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Labor markets in U.S. cities today are vastly more educated and skill-intensive than they were five decades ago. Yet, urban non-college workers perform substantially less skilled work than decades earlier. This deskilling reflects the joint effects of automation and international trade, which have eliminated the bulk of non-college production, administrative support, and clerical jobs, yielding a disproportionate polarization of urban labor markets. The unwinding of the urban non-college occupational skill gradient has, I argue, abetted a secular fall in real non-college wages by: (1) shunting non-college workers out of specialized middle-skill occupations into low-wage occupations that require only generic skills; (2) diminishing the set of non-college workers that hold middle-skill jobs in high-wage cities; and (3) attenuating, to a startling degree, the steep urban wage premium for non-college workers that prevailed in earlier decades. Changes in the nature of work—many of which are technological in origin—have been more disruptive and less beneficial for non-college than college workers.

<p><strong>Investigating Treatment Effects of Participating Jointly in SNAP and WIC when the Treatment is Validated Only for SNAP</strong></p>
<p>Helen H. Jensen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent Kreider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oleksandr Zhylyevskyy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
USDA operates several food assistance programs aimed at alleviating food insecurity. We study whether participation in both SNAP and WIC alleviates food insecurity compared with participation in SNAP alone. We bound underlying causal effects by applying nonparametric treatment effect methods that allow for endogenous selection and underrepresented program participation when validation data are available for one program (treatment) but not the other. We estimate average treatment effects using data from the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS). FoodAPS includes administrative data to validate SNAP participation.  Information on local food prices allows us to construct a food expenditure-based monotone instrumental variable that does not require a typical IV exclusion restriction. Under relatively weak monotonicity assumptions, we identify that the impact of participating in both programs relative to SNAP alone is strictly positive, suggesting that the programs are nonredundant. This evidence can support improved design and targeting of food programs.

<p><strong>Household Responses to Transfers and Liquidity: Evidence from Social Security's Survivors Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Itzik Fadlon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shanthi P. Ramnath&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patricia K. Tong&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We use administrative tax data that cover the U.S. population to identify the causal effects of Social Security’s survivors benefit receipt on American families’ behavior and financial well-being. We analyze over a quarter of a million widowed households in which the husband died between 2002-2007, and we exploit a sharp age discontinuity in benefit eligibility to study the responses of financially vulnerable households to government transfers. We first study how households respond to unanticipated benefit receipt in the immediate periods following a large financial shock to investigate the protective role of transfers. We find significant impacts of the program on newly-widowed families’ net income and labor supply behavior, which points to considerable allocative inefficiencies in the life insurance market and to a high valuation of survivors benefits in protecting Americans against mortality shocks. Second, to investigate the particular role of liquidity and benefit timing, we then study how already-widowed women’s labor supply responds to anticipated survivors benefit receipt. We find considerable responses to cash-on-hand via benefit availability that underscore allocative inefficiencies in the credit market and the value of liquidity itself provided by government transfers. These responses and their heterogeneity highlight mechanisms that underlie the labor supply behavior of older vulnerable households, and they point to liquidity constraints, rather than myopia or benefit-schedule misperceptions, as the likely operative channel. Our results have implications for survivors benefits in the U.S., and, more generally, for retirement behavior and response mechanisms to transfers among older vulnerable populations.

<p><strong>Digital Abundance and Scarce Genius: Implications for Wages, Interest Rates, and Growth</strong></p>
<p>Seth G. Benzell&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erik Brynjolfsson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Digital versions of labor and capital can be reproduced much more cheaply than their traditional forms. This increases the supply and reduces the marginal cost of both labor and capital. What then, if anything, is becoming scarcer? We posit a third factor, ‘genius’, that cannot be duplicated by digital technologies. Our approach resolves several macroeconomic puzzles. Over the last several decades, both real median wages and the real interest rate have been stagnant or falling in the United States and the World. Furthermore, shares of income paid to labor and capital (properly measured) have also decreased. And despite dramatic advances in digital technologies, the growth rate of measured output has not increased. No competitive neoclassical two-factor model can reconcile these trends. We show that when increasingly digitized capital and labor are sufficiently complementary to inelastically supplied genius, innovation augmenting either of the first two factors can decrease wages and interest rates in the short and long run. Growth is increasingly constrained by the scarce input, not labor or capital. We discuss microfoundations for genius, with a focus on the increasing importance of superstar labor. We also consider consequences for government policy and scale sustainability.

<p><strong>Mentally Spent: Credit Conditions and Mental Health</strong></p>
<p>Qing Hu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ross Levine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen Lin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingzhu Tai&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In light of the human suffering and economic costs associated with mental illness, we provide the first assessment of whether local credit conditions shape the incidence of mental depression. Using several empirical strategies, we discover that bank regulatory reforms that improved local credit conditions reduced mental depression among low-income households and the impact was largest in counties dominated by bank-dependent firms. On the mechanisms, we find that the regulatory reforms boosted employment, income, and mental health among low-income individuals in bank-dependent counties, but the regulatory reforms did not increase borrowing by these individuals.

<p><strong>Global Collateral and Capital Flows</strong></p>
<p>Ana Fostel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Geanakoplos&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory Phelan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cross-border financial flows arise when (otherwise identical) countries differ in their abilities to use assets as collateral to back financial contracts. Financially integrated countries have access to the same set of financial instruments, and yet there is no price convergence of assets with identical payoffs, due to a gap in collateral values. Home (financially advanced) runs a current account deficit. Financial flows amplify asset price volatility in both countries, and gross flows driven by collateral differences collapse following bad news about fundamentals. Our results can explain financial flows among rich, similarly-developed countries, and why these flows increase volatility.

<p><strong>Environmental Policy on the Back of an Envelope: A Cobb-Douglas Model is Not Just a Teaching Tool</strong></p>
<p>Don Fullerton&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chi L. Ta&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To clarify and interpret the workings of a large computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of environmental policy in the U.S., we build an aggregated Cobb-Douglas (CD) model that can be solved easily and analytically. Its closed-form expressions show exactly how key parameters determine the sign and size of effects from a large new carbon tax on emissions, revenue, prices, output, and welfare. Data and parameters from the detailed, dynamic CGE model of Goulder and Hafstead (2018) are used in the CD model to calculate results that can be compared with theirs. Results from the CD model track those from the large CGE model quite closely, even though the CD model omits much detail such as the number of sectors, intermediate inputs, and international trade. A CGE model is quite useful to generate detailed numerical results and to reflect on particular aspects of environmental policy, but the simpler CD model provides a transparent view of exactly how the policy affects key outcomes.

<p><strong>Paying for Kidneys? A Randomized Survey and Choice Experiment</strong></p>
<p>Julio J. Elias&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicola Lacetera&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mario Macis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Legislation and public policies are often the result of competition and compromise between different views and interests. In several cases, strongly held moral beliefs voiced by societal groups lead lawmakers to prohibit certain transactions or to prevent them from occurring through markets. However, there is limited evidence about the specific nature of the general population’s opposition to using prices in such contentious transactions. We conducted a randomized survey with 2,666 American residents to study preferences for legalizing payments to kidney donors. We found strong polarization, with many participants supporting or opposing payments regardless of potential transplant gains. However, about 18 percent of respondents would switch to favoring payments for sufficiently large increases in transplants. Preferences for compensation have strong moral foundations; participants especially reject direct payments by patients, which they find would violate principles of fairness. We corroborate the interpretation of our findings with a choice experiment of a costly decision to donate money to a foundation that supports donor compensation.

<p><strong>Amenities, Risk, and Flood Insurance Reform</strong></p>
<p>V. Kerry Smith&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Whitmore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This paper provides the first, comprehensive evidence on the question of whether the subsidized flood insurance rates are needed to meet the affordability goal of the National Flood Insurance Program. We use IRS records at the zip code level from 2009 to 2016 to compare the real median incomes of homeowners in areas subject to flooding risks to those homeowners in neighboring zip codes. Our analysis includes all of the Gulf Coast states and over 1000 other communities around the United States containing FEMA designated Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA). There are clear patterns of positive income stratification for coastal locations in Florida, New Jersey, and New York. We also find lower income for coastal locations in California, North Carolina, as well as the shoreline along rivers identified as in SFHA in Delaware, and Virginia fit this pattern.

<p><strong>Long-Term Discount Rates Do Not Vary Across Firms</strong></p>
<p>Matti Keloharju&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juhani T. Linnainmaa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Nyberg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Long-term expected returns appear to vary little, if at all, in the cross section of stocks. We devise a bootstrapping procedure that injects small amounts of variation into expected returns and show that even negligible differences in expected returns, if they existed, would be easy to detect. Markers of such differences, however, are absent from actual stock returns. Our estimates are consistent with production-based asset pricing models such as Berk, Green, and Naik (1999) and Gomes, Kogan, and Zhang (2003) in which firms' risks change over time. We show that long-term reversals in stock returns are the consequence of the rapid convergence in expected returns. Our results imply stock market anomalies have only a limited effect on firm valuations.

<p><strong>Market Power and Income Taxation</strong></p>
<p>Louis Kaplow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Does significant market power or the presence of large rents affect optimal income taxation, calling for greater redistribution due to tainted gains?  Or perhaps less because of an additional wedge that distorts labor effort?  Do concerns about inequality have implications for antitrust, regulation, trade, and other policies that influence market power, which contributes to inequality?  This article addresses these questions in a model with heterogeneous abilities and hence a concern for distribution, markups, multiple sectors, ownership that is a function of income, allowance for any share of profits to be recoveries of investments (including rent-seeking efforts), endogenous labor supply, and a nonlinear income tax.  In this model, proportional markups with no profit dissipation have no effect on the economy, and a policy that reduces a nonproportional markup raises (lowers) welfare when it is higher (lower) than a weighted average of other markups.  With proportional (partial or full) profit dissipation, proportional markups are equivalent to a downward shift of the distribution of abilities, and the welfare effect of correcting nonproportional markups associated with nonproportional profit dissipation now depends also on the degree of dissipation and how that is affected by the policy.  In all cases, optimal policies maximize consumer plus producer surplus, without regard to a policy’s distributive effects on consumers and profits or how markups and income taxation distort labor effort.

<p><strong>The Declining Labor Market Prospects of Less-Educated Men</strong></p>
<p>Ariel J. Binder&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Bound&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Over the last half century, U.S. wage growth stagnated, wage inequality rose, and the labor-force participation rate of prime-age men steadily declined.  In this article, we examine these labor market trends, focusing on outcomes for males without a college education.  Though wages and participation have fallen in tandem for this population, we argue that the canonical neo-classical framework, which postulates a labor demand curve shifting inward across a stable labor supply curve, does not reasonably explain the data.  Alternatives we discuss include adjustment frictions associated with labor demand shocks and effects of the changing marriage market—that is, the fact that fewer less-educated men are forming their own stable families—on male labor supply incentives.</p>

<p><strong>Experimental Evidence on the Effect of Information and Pricing on Residential Electricity Consumption</strong></p>
<p>Jesse Burkhardt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenneth Gillingham&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praveen K. Kopalle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This study examines a field experiment in Texas that includes pricing and informational interventions to encourage energy conservation during summer peak load days when the social cost of generation is the highest. We estimate that our critical peak pricing intervention reduces electricity consumption by 14%. Using unique high frequency appliance-level data, we can attribute 74% of this response to air conditioning. In contrast, we find minimal response to active information provision and conservation appeals. A complementary experimental program also lowers nighttime prices during the off-peak season, providing the first evidence of electric vehicle loadshifting in response to price.

<p><strong>Norms, Enforcement, and Tax Evasion</strong></p>
<p>Timothy Besley&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anders Jensen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torsten Persson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This paper studies individual and social motives in tax evasion. We build a simple dynamic model that incorporates these motives and their interaction. The social motives underpin the role of norms and is the source of the dynamics that we study. Our empirical analysis exploits the adoption in 1990 of a poll tax to fund local government in the UK, which led to widespread evasion. The evidence is consistent with the model's main predictions on the dynamics of evasion.

<p><strong>Are Sufficient Statistics Necessary? Nonparametric Measurement of Deadweight Loss from Unemployment Insurance</strong></p>
<p>David S. Lee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pauline Leung&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher J. O'Leary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhuan Pei&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon Quach&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Central to the welfare analysis of income transfer programs is the deadweight loss associated with possible reforms. To aid analytical tractability, its measurement typically requires specifying a simplified model of behavior. We employ a complementary “decomposition” approach that compares the behavioral and mechanical components of a policy’s total impact on the government budget to study the deadweight loss of two unemployment insurance policies. Experimental and quasi-experimental estimates using state administrative data show that increasing the weekly benefit is more efficient (with a fiscal externality of 53 cents per dollar of mechanical transferred income) than reducing the program’s implicit earnings tax.

<p><strong>Demand for Crash Insurance, Intermediary Constraints, and Risk Premia in Financial Markets</strong></p>
<p>Hui Chen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott Joslin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophie X. Ni&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We propose a new measure of financial intermediary constraints based on how the intermediaries manage their tail risk exposures. Using data for the trading activities in the market of deep out-of-the-money S&P 500 put options, we identify periods when the variations in the net amount of trading between financial intermediaries and public investors are likely to be mainly driven by shocks to intermediary constraints. We then infer tightness of intermediary constraints from the quantities of option trading during such periods. A tightening of intermediary constraint according to our measure is associated with increasing option expensiveness, higher risk premia for a wide range of financial assets, deterioration in funding liquidity, and broker-dealer deleveraging.

<p><strong>Employer Concerns and Responses to an Aging Workforce</strong></p>
<p>Robert L. Clark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven Nyce&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beth Ritter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John B. Shoven&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Economist and public policy analysts have devoted considerable research to examining the work and retirement decisions of employees.  Much less effort has been spent on understanding the concerns and challenges of employers if their workers delay retirement and remain on the job until older ages.  In this study, we report findings from three employer surveys with the objective of learning how organizations are responding to the aging of their workforces.  The surveys provide several important observations.  First, employer concerns about workforce aging vary considerably across the economy.  To some firms, these demographic changes are of immediate concern and are viewed as a significant risk to the organization while other firms remain more concerned about potential productivity and cost effect of an older labor force.  Second, most employers expect the importance of workforce aging to increase in the next five years.  In response, a significant proportion of organizations are making changes to working conditions and compensation policies.  Third, firms remain reluctant to adopt formal phased retirement policies but are more willing to offer part-time employment, return to work, and other policies on a case by case basis.
