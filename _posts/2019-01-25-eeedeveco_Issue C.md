<p><strong>Ex ante and ex post effects of hybrid index insurance in Bangladesh</strong></p>
<p>Ruth Hill&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neha Kumar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas Magnan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simrin Makhija&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francesca de Nicola&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David J. Spielman&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick S. Ward&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study assesses both the demand for and effectiveness of an index insurance product designed to help smallholder farmers in Bangladesh manage crop production risk during the monsoon season. Villages were randomized into either an insurance treatment or a comparison group, and discounts and rebates were randomly allocated across treatment villages to encourage insurance take-up and to allow for the estimation of the price-elasticity of insurance demand. Among those offered insurance, we find demand to be fairly price elastic, with discounts significantly more successful in stimulating demand than rebates. Purchasing insurance yields both ex ante risk management effects as well as ex post income effects on agricultural production practices. The risk management effects lead to an expansion of cultivated area with concomitant increases in agricultural input expenditures during the monsoon season. The income effects lead to more intensive rice production during the subsequent dry season, with more intensive use of both irrigation and fertilizers, resulting in higher yields and higher total rice production.</p>

<p><strong>Making an impact? The relevance of information on aid effectiveness for charitable giving. A laboratory experiment</strong></p>
<p>Laura Metzger&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabel Günther&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a laboratory experiment, we analyze individuals' demand for information about a donation's welfare impact, and compare it with demand for information on recipient types and administrative costs. We find the least demand for information about aid impact, indicating that individuals either do not understand, do not trust, or do not care about the specific information we provide. Average donations increase in response to information about the recipient type and decrease in response to information about administrative costs. Information about aid impact does not significantly change average donations: donors who demand information respond positively to high impact projects and negatively to low impact projects, resulting in a zero net effect on donation levels. Our results further show that information has the same effect on donation behavior regardless of whether it is provided for free or at a cost.</p>

<p><strong>Family clans and public goods: Evidence from the New Village Beautification Project in South Korea</strong></p>
<p>Hyunjoo Yang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethnic and linguistic heterogeneity are widely studied as determinants of social capital, conflict, and institutional quality. In many cultures, another important dimension of heterogeneity is family clan membership. I study the relationship between family clan diversity in South Korean villages and the voluntary production of public goods and contributions of private resources for village projects. Under the 1970–1971 New Village Beautification Project, the government distributed resources to each village for the production of village public goods. Subsequently, the government systematically evaluated how well these resources were applied. I combine these data with information on village family clan structures collected by the Japanese Colonial Government, as well as records of land donations for village projects between 1970 and 1980. I find an inverted-U-shaped effect of group heterogeneity on the improvement of public goods.</p>

<p><strong>Affirmative action, education and gender: Evidence from India</strong></p>
<p>Guilhem Cassan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper studies the impact of India's affirmative action policies for Scheduled Castes on educational attainment. Using a plausibly exogenous variation, I show that affirmative action increases educational attainment. The main improvements are in literacy and secondary schooling and there is only small evidence of increases in higher education. The benefits are not distributed evenly across genders: only males show an increase in education (in literacy, primary and secondary completion). Individuals at the intersection of discriminated groups (low caste and female) may not be benefiting from these policies.</p>

<p><strong>Vocational training programs and youth labor market outcomes: Evidence from Nepal</strong></p>
<p>Shubha Chakravarty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mattias Lundberg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plamen Nikolov&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliane Zenker&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•We are among the first to study a vocational training program in a low-income country.•We find large effects of trainees taking up informal non-farm employment.•Impacts are mainly driven by female self-employment inside (but not outside) the house.•Low baseline educational attainment and restrictive gender roles for females in Nepal may explain our large program effects.•We suggest that effect channels differ markedly from similar interventions in high and middle-income countries.</p>

<p><strong>Efficiency of region-wide catastrophic weather risk pools: Implications for African Risk Capacity insurance program</strong></p>
<p>Sebastain N. Awondo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an attempt to better manage extreme weather risk using (re)insurance and securitizing devices, the African Union recently established the Africa Risk Capacity (ARC) to pool extreme drought risk across Africa. We investigate the prevalence of systemic risk within potential ARC risk pools and its effect on diversifying drought risk using rainfall index-insurance. To develop an index that captures the tail behavior of losses, we employ a two-stage process that involves a vector autoregressive model and nested Archimedean copulas. Finally, using the loss distributions, we derive and compare buffer load and pooling effects across risk pools. Overall, we find strong benefits in pooling drought risk in Africa. However, the benefits are highly heterogeneous across risk pools, some of which are very inefficient. The heterogeneity was found to be driven by non-linear dependence among losses that tends to be stronger in the tails of the distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Long-lasting income shocks and adaptations: Evidence from coral bleaching in Indonesia</strong></p>
<p>Pasita Chaijaroen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper explores how people adapt to climate shocks, specifically coral bleaching, that have long-lasting impacts on income. Caused mainly by abnormally high sea surface temperature, coral bleaching has significant effects on marine resources. Using panel data from Indonesia and exogenous variations in bleaching, I observe that fishery households in affected areas experienced a decrease in income relative to other households. Although consumption expenditures did not decline significantly in response to these income shocks, these households reduced their protein consumption in the short and long runs. Regarding labor market outcomes, the affected households tended to substantially increase their labor supply and switch industries only in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>Maize and precolonial Africa</strong></p>
<p>Jevan Cherniwchan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreno-Cruz, Juan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Columbus's arrival in the New World triggered an unprecedented movement of people and crops across the Atlantic Ocean. We study a largely overlooked part of this Columbian Exchange: the effects of New World crops in Africa. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that the introduction of maize increased population density and slave exports in precolonial Africa. We find robust empirical support for these predictions. We also find little evidence to suggest maize increased economic growth or reduced conflict. Our results suggest that rather than stimulating development, the introduction of maize simply increased the supply of slaves during the slave trades.</p>

<p><strong>Spatially heterogeneous effects of a public works program</strong></p>
<p>Joshua D. Merfeld&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most research on labor market effects of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme focuses on outcomes at the district level. This paper shows that such a focus masks substantial spatial heterogeneity: treated villages located near untreated areas see smaller increases in casual wages than treated villages located farther from untreated areas. Spatial differences in implementation or program leakages do not appear to drive this spatial heterogeneity. The effects of the program on private-sector employment display similar intra-district heterogeneity and these effects on employment are highly correlated with the effect on wages. Overall, these results suggest that worker mobility leads a district-level focus to underestimate the true effect of the program on wages. Quantifying this underestimate using two separate methods produces very similar results; the overall effect on wages appears to be approximately twice as large as district-level estimates suggest.</p>
