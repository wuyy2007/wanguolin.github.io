<p><strong>Innovation and Top Income Inequality</strong></p>
<p>Philippe Aghion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ufuk Akcigit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antonin Bergeaud&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard Blundell&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Hemous&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, we use cross-state panel and cross-U.S. commuting-zone data to look at the relationship between innovation, top income inequality and social mobility. We find positive correlations between measures of innovation and top income inequality. We also show that the correlations between innovation and broad measures of inequality are not significant. Next, using instrumental variable analysis, we argue that these correlations at least partly reflect a causality from innovation to top income shares. Finally, we show that innovation, particularly by new entrants, is positively associated with social mobility, but less so in local areas with more intense lobbying activities.</p>

<p><strong>The Elusive Pro-Competitive Effects of Trade</strong></p>
<p>Costas Arkolakis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arnaud Costinot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave Donaldson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andres Rodriguez-Clare&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We study the gains from trade liberalization in models with monopolistic competition, firm-level heterogeneity, and variable markups. For a large class of demand functions used in the international macro and trade literature, we derive a parsimonious generalization of the welfare formula in Arkolakis et al. (2012). We then use both estimates from micro-level trade data and evidence regarding firm-level pass-through to quantify the implications of this new formula. Within the class of models that we consider, our main finding is that gains from trade liberalization predicted by models with variable markups are equal to, at best, and slightly lower than, at worst, those predicted by models with constant markups. In this sense, pro-competitive effects of trade are elusive.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy-proofness in the Large</strong></p>
<p>Eduardo M Azevedo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric Budish&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose a criterion of approximate incentive compatibility, strategy-proofness in the large (SP-L), and argue that it is a useful second-best to exact strategy-proofness (SP) for market design. Conceptually, SP-L requires that an agent who regards a mechanism’s “prices” as exogenous to her report—be they traditional prices as in an auction mechanism, or price-like statistics in an assignment or matching mechanism—has a dominant strategy to report truthfully. Mathematically, SP-L weakens SP in two ways: (1) truth-telling is required to be approximately optimal (within epsilon in a large enough market) rather than exactly optimal, and (2) incentive compatibility is evaluated ex interim, with respect to all full-support i.i.d. probability distributions of play, rather than ex post with respect to all possible realizations of play. This places SP-L in between the traditional notion of approximate SP, which evaluates incentives to manipulate ex post and as a result is too strong to obtain our main results in support of SP-L, and the traditional notion of approximate Bayes-Nash incentive compatibility, which, like SP-L, evaluates incentives to manipulate ex interim, but which imposes common knowledge and strategic sophistication assumptions that are often viewed as unrealistic.</p>

<p><strong>Public R&D Investments and Private-sector Patenting: Evidence from NIH Funding Rules</strong></p>
<p>Pierre Azoulay&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua Graff Zivin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danielle Li&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhaven N Sampat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We quantify the impact of scientific grant funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on patenting by pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms. Our article makes two contributions. First, we use newly constructed bibliometric data to develop a method for flexibly linking specific grant expenditures to private-sector innovations. Second, we take advantage of idiosyncratic rigidities in the rules governing NIH peer review to generate exogenous variation in funding across research areas. Our results show that NIH funding spurs the development of private-sector patents: a $10 million boost in NIH funding leads to a net increase of 2.7 patents. Though valuing patents is difficult, we report a range of estimates for the private value of these patents using different approaches.</p>

<p><strong>An Empirical Model of Wage Dispersion with Sorting</strong></p>
<p>Jesper Bagger&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasmus Lentz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate an equilibrium on-the-job search model with endogenous search intensity. Workers differ by skill, firms by productivity. Workers respond to mismatch by intensive search, and sorting may result from complementarities in the match-level production function. The model is estimated on Danish-matched employer–employee data. Firms are ranked through revealed preference by the fraction of hires that is poached from other firms: the poaching rank. Identification is obtained by firm rank conditional mobility and wage patterns. Wage variation is decomposed into four sources: sorting (40%), worker heterogeneity (32%), firm heterogeneity (18%), and frictional competition (10%). A social planner can improve output net of search cost by 1.5% relative to the decentralized solution.</p>

<p><strong>Breaking the Glass Ceiling? The Effect of Board Quotas on Female Labour Market Outcomes in Norway</strong></p>
<p>Marianne Bertrand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra E Black&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sissel Jensen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adriana Lleras-Muney&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late 2003, Norway passed a law mandating 40% representation of each gender on the board of public limited liability companies. The primary objective of this reform was to increase the representation of women in top positions in the corporate sector and decrease the gender disparity in earnings within that sector. We document that the women appointed to these boards post-reform were observably more qualified than their female predecessors along many dimensions, and that the gender gap in earnings within boards fell substantially. However, we see no robust evidence that the reform benefited the larger set of women employed in the companies subject to the quota. Moreover, the reform had no clear impact on highly qualified women whose qualifications mirror those of board members but who were not appointed to boards. Finally, we find mixed support for the view that the reform affected the decisions of young women. While the reform was not accompanied by any change in female enrollment in business education programmes, we do see some improvements in labour market outcomes for young women with graduate business degrees in their early career stages; however, we observe similar improvements for young women with graduate science degrees, suggesting this may not be due to the reform. Overall, seven years after the board quota policy fully came into effect, we conclude that it had very little discernible impact on women in business beyond its direct effect on the women who made it into boardrooms.</p>

<p><strong>The Price Effects of Cash Versus In-Kind Transfers</strong></p>
<p>Jesse M Cunha&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giacomo  De Giorgi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seema Jayachandran&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article examines the effect of cash versus in-kind transfers on local prices. Both types of transfers increase the demand for normal goods; in-kind transfers also increase supply in recipient communities, which could lead to lower prices than under cash transfers. We test and confirm this prediction using a programme in Mexico that randomly assigned villages to receive boxes of food (trucked into the village), equivalently-valued cash transfers, or no transfers. We find that prices are significantly lower under in-kind transfers compared to cash transfers; relative to the control group, in-kind transfers cause a 4% fall in prices while cash transfers cause a positive but negligible increase in prices. In the more economically developed villages in the sample, households’ purchasing power is only modestly affected by these price effects. In the less developed villages, the price effects are much larger in magnitude, which we show is due to these villages being less tied to the outside economy and having less competition among local suppliers.</p>

<p><strong>Efficient Sovereign Default</strong></p>
<p>Alessandro Dovis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, I show that the key aspects of sovereign debt crises can be rationalized as part of the efficient risk-sharing arrangement between a sovereign borrower and foreign lenders in a production economy with informational and commitment frictions. The constrained efficient allocation involves ex post inefficient outcomes that resemble sovereign default episodes in the data and can be implemented with non-contingent defaultable bonds and active maturity management. Defaults and periods of temporary exclusion from international credit markets happen along the equilibrium path and are essential to supporting the efficient allocation. Furthermore, during debt crises, the maturity composition of debt shifts towards short-term debt and the term premium inverts as in the data.</p>

<p><strong>Correlation Neglect in Belief Formation</strong></p>
<p>Benjamin Enke&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florian Zimmermann&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many information structures generate correlated rather than mutually independent signals, the news media being a prime example. This article provides experimental evidence that many people neglect the resulting double-counting problem in the updating process. In consequence, beliefs are too sensitive to the ubiquitous “telling and re-telling of stories” and exhibit excessive swings. We identify substantial and systematic heterogeneity in the presence of the bias and investigate the underlying mechanisms. The evidence points to the paramount importance of complexity in combination with people’s problems in identifying and thinking through the correlation. Even though most participants in principle have the computational skills that are necessary to develop rational beliefs, many approach the problem in a wrong way when the environment is moderately complex. Thus, experimentally nudging people’s focus towards the correlation and the underlying independent signals has large effects on beliefs.</p>

<p><strong>State Taxes and Spatial Misallocation</strong></p>
<p>Pablo D Fajgelbaum&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eduardo Morales&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan Carlos Suárez Serrato&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owen Zidar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We study state taxes as a potential source of spatial misallocation in the U.S.. We build a spatial general equilibrium framework that incorporates salient features of the U.S. state tax system, and use changes in state tax rates between 1980 and 2010 to estimate the model parameters that determine how worker and firm location respond to changes in state taxes. We find that heterogeneity in state tax rates leads to aggregate welfare losses. In terms of consumption equivalent units, harmonizing state taxes increases worker welfare by 0.6% if government spending is held constant, and by 1.2% if government spending responds endogenously. Harmonization of state taxes within Census regions achieves most of these gains. We also use our model to study the general equilibrium effects of recently implemented and proposed tax reforms.</p>

<p><strong>Inference on Directionally Differentiable Functions</strong></p>
<p>Zheng Fang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andres Santos&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article studies an asymptotic framework for conducting inference on parameters of the form $\phi(\theta_0)$, where $\phi$ is a known directionally differentiable function and $\theta_0$ is estimated by $\hat \theta_n$. In these settings, the asymptotic distribution of the plug-in estimator $\phi(\hat \theta_n)$ can be derived employing existing extensions to the Delta method. We show, however, that (full) differentiability of $\phi$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for bootstrap consistency whenever the limiting distribution of $\hat \theta_n$ is Gaussian. An alternative resampling scheme is proposed that remains consistent when the bootstrap fails, and is shown to provide local size control under restrictions on the directional derivative of $\phi$. These results enable us to reduce potentially challenging statistical problems to simple analytical calculations—a feature we illustrate by developing a test of whether an identified parameter belongs to a convex set. We highlight the empirical relevance of our results by conducting inference on the qualitative features of trends in (residual) wage inequality in the U.S.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Intermediary Capital</strong></p>
<p>Adriano A Rampini&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S Viswanathan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose a dynamic theory of financial intermediaries that are better able to collateralize claims than households, that is, have a collateralization advantage. Intermediaries require capital as they have to finance the additional amount that they can lend out of their own net worth. The net worth of financial intermediaries and the corporate sector are both state variables affecting the spread between intermediated and direct finance and the dynamics of real economic activity, such as investment, and financing. The accumulation of net worth of intermediaries is slow relative to that of the corporate sector. The model is consistent with key stylized facts about macroeconomic downturns associated with a credit crunch, namely, their severity, their protractedness, and the fact that the severity of the credit crunch itself affects the severity and persistence of downturns. The model captures the tentative and halting nature of recoveries from crises.</p>
