<p><strong>Economic growth in the long run</strong></p>
<p>Robert Tamura&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerry Dwyer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Devereux&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott Baier&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We present new data on real output per worker, schooling per worker, human capital per worker, real physical capital per worker for 168 countries. The output data represent all available data from Maddison. The physical capital data represent all available data from Mitchell. One major contribution is a new data set of human capital per worker, the foundation of which comes mostly from Mitchell. We provide original estimates of schooling per worker & per young worker. Using standard Mincer human capital construction, we find that variation in inputs can explain about 46% of the variation in long run living standards using standard covariance accounting. With capital intensity covariance accounting, variation in inputs explains about 25% of the variation in long run living standards. With intergenerational human capital accumulation with or without spillovers, we find that variation in inputs can explain at least half of the long run variation in living standards.</p>

<p><strong>The surprising instability of export specializations</strong></p>
<p>Diego Daruich&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Easterly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ariell Reshef&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We study the instability of hyper-specialization of exports at the 4-digit level in 1998–2010. (1) Specializations are surprisingly un-stable. Export ranks are not persistent, and new top products and destinations replace old ones. Measurement error is unlikely to be the main or only determinant of this pattern. (2) Source country factors are not the main explanation of this instability. Only 16–20% of variation in export growth is accounted for by source country plus source country-product factors that do not vary across destinations. The high share of idiosyncratic variance (source-product-destination residual) of 41–55%, indicates the difficulty to predict export success using source country characteristics. While we are cautious in interpreting factors that are jointly determined in global general equilibrium, our results suggest that destination and product-specific factors importantly matter at least as much as source country factors.</p>

<p><strong>Quality, quantity, and spatial variation of price: Back to the bog</strong></p>
<p>John Gibson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonggeun Kim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimating potential effects of price reforms is a key issue for many developing countries. Demand studies increasingly use household survey data on budget shares, which vary with quantity, price, and quality. If quality response to price is ignored, estimated price elasticities of quantity demand conflate responses on quantity and quality margins. Our review finds over 80% of published studies using budget shares from household survey data have this error. We use survey data from Vietnam, with prices and qualities observed over space, to directly estimate the price elasticity of quality. This is much larger than what is derived from the income elasticity of quality, based on the Deaton (1988) separability restrictions. Across the 45 items we study, the own-price elasticity of quantity demand is overstated by a factor of four, on average, if the response of quality to price is ignored.</p>

<p><strong>Income hiding and informal redistribution: A lab-in-the-field experiment in Senegal</strong></p>
<p>Marie Boltz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karine Marazyan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paola Villar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate the hidden cost of social obligations to redistribute exploiting data from a controlled setting in urban Senegal, which combines lab-in-the-field measures and out-of-lab follow-up data. We estimate a social tax of about 9 percent. When given the opportunity to get hidden income, individuals decrease by 26 percent the share of gains they transfer to kin — mostly outside the household — and increase health and personal expenses. We expand on prior literature by both identifying the individual cost of informal redistribution and then relating it to postexperiment resource-allocation decisions, and by disentangling intra- and interhousehold redistributive pressure.</p>

<p><strong>Crop prices and the demand for titled land: Evidence from Uganda</strong></p>
<p>Viviana M.E. Perego&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I investigate how agricultural prices affect demand for titled land, using panel data on Ugandan farmers, and a price index that weighs international crop prices by the structure of land use at the sub-county level. Higher prices increase farmers' share of titled land. I also present evidence of a positive impact of prices on agricultural incomes. The effect of prices on land tenure is stronger when farmers have access to roads and markets, when they have undertaken investment on the land, and when households fear land grabbing.</p>

<p><strong>Short-term subsidies and seller type: A health products experiment in Uganda</strong></p>
<p>Greg Fischer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean Karlan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margaret McConnell&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pia Raffler&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way in which a product is distributed can have lasting effects on demand by influencing learning, anchoring price expectations, and shaping perceptions of product value. While these issues apply broadly, they are particularly important for health products in poor countries, where short-term subsidies are common, similar products are often available through both non-profit and for-profit organizations, and expanding access is an important public health goal. We implemented a field experiment in northern Uganda in which three curative health products were distributed door-to-door either free or for sale and by either an NGO or for-profit company. For all three products, subsequent purchase rates were lower after a free distribution. While we see no difference in subsequent purchase rates based on seller type, we find that contemporaneous demand for a newly introduced product is higher when the seller identifies as a not-for-profit organization.</p>

<p><strong>What's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine: Field experiment on income concealing between spouses in India</strong></p>
<p>Carolina Castilla&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this paper, I present results from a field-laboratory experiment in India where individuals in established marriages were randomly given the opportunity to choose to keep money private from their partner, assigned to a complete information, or to a private information treatment. The experiment was designed to test the effect of private information at the time when spouses decide on the amount of resources to bargain over with their partners (pre-bargaining stage) on intra-household allocation. I show that in the presence of asymmetric information 25% of spouses choose to keep (some) money private when given the opportunity, thus reducing the pool that their partners observe. The strategic exploitation of information advantages results in efficiency losses that amount up to 24% of average maximum potential earnings. The analysis suggests the mechanism driving the results is an income-hiding motive, and not alternative explanations such as mental accounting or alternative strategic behaviors.</p>
