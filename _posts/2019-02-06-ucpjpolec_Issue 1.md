<p><strong>Temporary Migration and Endogenous Risk Sharing in Village India</strong></p>
<p>Melanie Morten&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people can self-insure via migration, they may have less need for informal risk sharing. At the same time, informal insurance may reduce the need to migrate. To understand the joint determination of migration and risk sharing, I study a dynamic model of risk sharing with limited commitment frictions and endogenous temporary migration. First, I characterize the model. Second, I structurally estimate the model using the new ICRISAT panel from rural India. Third, I introduce a rural employment scheme. The policy reduces migration and decreases risk sharing, lowering the welfare gain of the policy.</p>

<p><strong>Private Outsourcing and Competition: Subsidized Food Distribution in Indonesia</strong></p>
<p>Abhijit Banerjee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rema Hanna&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jordan Kyle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin A. Olken&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudarno Sumarto&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We explore the impact of allowing for outsourcing service delivery to the private sector within Indonesia's largest targeted transfer program. In a field experiment across 572 municipalities, we find that allowing for outsourcing the last mile of food delivery reduced operating costs without sacrificing quality. However, the prices citizens paid were lower only where we modified the bidding rules to encourage more bidders. Higher rents are associated with greater entry despite elites' efforts to block reform. In this context, the option to outsource and sufficient competition generated significant benefits relative to public distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Equilibrium Search with Multiple Attributes and the Impact of Equal Opportunities for Women</strong></p>
<p>Melvyn G. Coles&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marco Francesconi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper considers equilibrium two-sided search with ex ante heterogeneous agents, vectors of attributes, and idiosyncratic match draws. The analysis applies to a large class of models, from the nontransferable utility case to the collective household model with bargaining, for which transferable utility is a special case. The approach is powerful for it identifies a simple algorithm that, in our numerical application, is found to rapidly converge to equilibrium. Our application explores the impact of equal opportunities for women in the labor market on female match incentives and the timing of marriage.</p>

<p><strong>"Nash-in-Nash" Bargaining: A Microfoundation for Applied Work</strong></p>
<p>Allan Collard-Wexler&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gautam Gowrisankaran&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robin S. Lee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "Nash equilibrium in Nash bargains" has become a workhorse bargaining model in applied analyses of bilateral oligopoly. This paper proposes a noncooperative foundation for "Nash-in-Nash" bargaining that extends Rubinstein's alternating offers model to multiple upstream and downstream firms. We provide conditions on firms' marginal contributions under which there exists, for sufficiently short time between offers, an equilibrium with agreement among all firms at prices arbitrarily close to Nash-in-Nash prices, that is, each pair's Nash bargaining solution given agreement by all other pairs. Conditioning on equilibria without delayed agreement, limiting prices are unique. Unconditionally, they are unique under stronger assumptions.</p>

<p><strong>Monopolistic Competition and Optimum Product Diversity under Firm Heterogeneity</strong></p>
<p>Swati Dhingra&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Morrow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empirical work has drawn attention to the high degree of productivity differences within industries and their role in resource allocation. This paper examines the allocational efficiency of such markets. Productivity differences introduce two new margins of potential inefficiency: selection of the right distribution of firms and allocation of the right quantities across firms. We show that these considerations affect welfare and policy analysis, and market power across firms leads to distortions in resource allocation. Demand-side elasticities determine how resources are misallocated and when increased competition from market expansion provides welfare gains.</p>

<p><strong>The Market for Financial Adviser Misconduct</strong></p>
<p>Mark Egan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregor Matvos&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amit Seru&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We document the economywide extent of misconduct among financial advisers and the associated labor market consequences. Seven percent of advisers have misconduct records, and this share reaches more than 15 percent at some of the largest firms. Roughly one-third of advisers with misconduct are repeat offenders. Approximately half of advisers lose their jobs after misconduct. The labor market partially undoes firm-level discipline by rehiring such advisers. Firms that persistently engage in misconduct coexist with firms that have clean records. We show that this phenomenon may be explained by some firms “specializing” in misconduct and catering to unsophisticated consumers.</p>

<p><strong>Culture and Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Beatrix Eugster&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raphaël Parchet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose a difference-in-differences strategy to identify the existence of interjurisdictional tax competition. Our strategy rests on differences between desired tax levels determined by culture-specific preferences and equilibrium tax levels determined by fiscal externalities and by preferences. While preferences differ systematically between French-speaking and German-speaking Swiss municipalities, local income tax burdens exhibit smooth spatial gradients. To qualify the empirical evidence, we develop a theoretical model of strategic tax setting by local governments that anticipate the effects of taxes on the per capita income and the median “hedonic” income, two inextricable consequences of the sorting of heterogeneous individuals.</p>

<p><strong>Screening and Adverse Selection in Frictional Markets</strong></p>
<p>Benjamin Lester&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali Shourideh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venky Venkateswaran&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ariel Zetlin-Jones&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We incorporate a search-theoretic model of imperfect competition into a standard model of asymmetric information with unrestricted contracts. We characterize the unique equilibrium and use our characterization to explore the interaction between adverse selection, screening, and imperfect competition. We show that the relationship between an agent’s type, the quantity he trades, and the price he pays is jointly determined by the severity of adverse selection and the concentration of market power. Therefore, quantifying the effects of adverse selection requires controlling for market structure. We also show that increasing competition and reducing informational asymmetries can decrease welfare.</p>

<p><strong>Dispute Resolution Institutions and Strategic Militarization</strong></p>
<p>Adam Meirowitz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Massimo Morelli&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kristopher W. Ramsay&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francesco Squintani&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engagement in a destructive war can be understood as the “punishment” for entering into a dispute. Institutions that reduce the chance that disputes lead to war make this punishment less severe. This may incentivize hawkish policies like militarization and potentially offset the benefits of peace brokering. We study a model in which unmediated peace talks are effective at improving the peace chance for given militarization but lead to more militarization and ultimately to a higher incidence of war. Instead, a form of third-party mediation inspired by work of Myerson effectively brokers peace in emerged disputes and also minimizes equilibrium militarization.</p>

<p><strong>Random Choice and Learning</strong></p>
<p>Paulo Natenzon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Context-dependent individual choice challenges the principle of utility maximization. I explain context dependence as the optimal response of an imperfectly informed agent to the ease of comparison of the options. I introduce a discrete choice model, the Bayesian probit, which allows the analyst to identify stable preferences from context-dependent choice data. My model accommodates observed behavioral phenomena--including the attraction and compromise effects--that lie beyond the scope of any random utility model. I use data from frog mating choices to illustrate how the model can outperform the random utility framework in goodness of fit and out-of-sample prediction.</p>

<p><strong>Democracy Does Cause Growth</strong></p>
<p>Daron Acemoglu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suresh Naidu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pascual Restrepo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James A. Robinson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide evidence that democracy has a positive effect on GDP per capita. Our dynamic panel strategy controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy. To reduce measurement error, we introduce a new indicator of democracy that consolidates previous measures. Our baseline results show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run. We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional waves of democratization. The effects are similar across different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater investments in capital, schooling, and health.</p>
