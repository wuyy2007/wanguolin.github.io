<p><strong>Global credit supply shocks and exchange rate regimes</strong></p>
<p>Nadav Ben Zeev&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent global financial crisis has re-emphasized the need for better understanding the relation between the type of exchange rate regime (ERR) in place and the effects of global credit supply shocks. Recent advances in the measurement of such shocks and their large realizations in the recent financial crisis produce a suitable quasi-natural experiment for studying this relation. Toward this end, I use ERR classification data for a panel of 40 emerging market economies (EMEs) to establish the following main findings: output responds significantly more adversely to contractionary global credit supply shocks in the fixed ERR than in the non-fixed ERR; deleveraging and the fall in imports are much more severe in the fixed ERR; and the lack of exchange rate depreciation in the fixed ERR is accompanied by a stronger fall in exports. These results are broadly consistent with predictions from models which include both the expenditure-switching channel and the balance sheet channel of exchange rate depreciation, where the latter channel effectively becomes expansionary, rather than contractionary as commonly thought, owing to favorable effects of the expenditure-switching channel on balance sheets' asset side.</p>

<p><strong>Contractual imperfections and the impact of crises on trade: Evidence from industry-level data</strong></p>
<p>Renzo Castellares&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jorge Salas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use industry-level data to study the effects of imperfect contract enforcement on international trade during crises. To guide the empirical work, we build a simple trade model with contractual imperfections, in which an adverse aggregate shock in the importing country generates a disproportionate decline in imports in more contractually vulnerable industries. Using disaggregated trade data for more than 120 countries and different industry measures of contractual dependence, we find robust support for the model's predictions. Our empirical approach exploits the variation in the occurrence of recessions and financial crises across countries and years, and the variation in contractual dependence across manufacturing industries. We show that the amplification effects of contractual dependence on sectoral imports are statistically and economically significant.</p>

<p><strong>Multidivisional firms, internal competition, and comparative advantage: Baye et al. Meet Neary</strong></p>
<p>Hamid Beladi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avik Chakrabarti&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We present a tractable general equilibrium model to capture the effects of divisionalization on trade in oligopolistic industries. Divisionalization reduces the incentives for diversification in production. The extensive margins of trade expand as a result of divisionalization, facilitating specialization toward the direction of comparative advantage, with exports rising in the case of domestic divisionalization and imports rising in the case of foreign divisionalization. This effect of internal competition on specialization is magnified when competition between divisions is staggered. The factor market effects of divisionalization, domestic and/or foreign, strengthen the expansionary effects on the extensive margins of trade.</p>

<p><strong>The effect of investing abroad on investment at home: On the role of technology, tax savings, and internal capital markets</strong></p>
<p>Stefan Goldbach&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arne Nagengast&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elias Steinmüller&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Georg Wamser&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper examines the relationship between foreign and domestic investment activity of multinational enterprises. The empirical analysis is based on micro data of German firms and their operations at home and abroad, including information on investment in fixed assets. The empirical approach, which rests upon extensive and intensive margin variation, is shown to produce very robust results. These suggest a positive relationship between foreign and home investment in real capital. This positive effect seems to be mainly related to additional opportunities for tax planning and better access to financing capital. In contrast, we do not find evidence that improved production processes and technology upgrading cause the positive effect on investment at home. Our empirical approach allows us to distinguish between an extensive and intensive margin effect: setting up a new foreign affiliate leads to an immediate positive effect of about EUR 460,000 additional investment; the investment elasticity at the intensive margin is estimated to be approximately 0.13.</p>

<p><strong>Finance and synchronization</strong></p>
<p>Cesa-Bianchi, Ambrogio&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean Imbs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jumana Saleheen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the workhorse model of international real business cycles, financial integration exacerbates the cycle asymmetry created by country-specific supply shocks. The prediction is identical in response to purely common shocks in the same model augmented with simple country heterogeneity (e.g., where depreciation rates or factor shares are different across countries). This happens because common shocks have heterogeneous consequences on the marginal products of capital across countries, which triggers international investment. In the data, filtering out common shocks requires therefore allowing for country-specific loadings. We show that finance and synchronization correlate negatively in response to such common shocks, consistent with previous findings. But finance and synchronization correlate non-negatively, almost always positively, in response to purely country-specific shocks.</p>

<p><strong>Step away from the zero lower bound: Small open economies in a world of secular stagnation</strong></p>
<p>Giancarlo Corsetti&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleonora Mavroeidi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory Thwaites&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin Wolf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We study how small open economies can escape from deflation and unemployment in a situation where the world economy is permanently depressed. Building on the framework of Eggertsson et al. (2016), we show that the transition to full employment and at-target inflation requires real and nominal depreciation of the exchange rate. However, because of adverse income and valuation effects from real depreciation, the escape has a beggar-thy-self effect, that may end up lowering welfare while eliminating underemployment. We show that as long as the economy remains financially open, domestic asset supply policies or reducing the effective lower bound on policy rates may be ineffective or even counterproductive. However, closing domestic capital markets does not necessarily enhance the monetary authorities' ability to rescue the economy from stagnation.</p>

<p><strong>Exporter heterogeneity and price discrimination: A quantitative view</strong></p>
<p>Jae Wook Jung&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ina Simonovska&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ariel Weinberger&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We quantify a general equilibrium model of international trade and pricing-to-market that features firm-level heterogeneity and consumers with non-homothetic preferences—generalized CES (GCES). We demonstrate theoretically that, relative to existing frameworks, the GCES model exhibits features of the data that are essential to conduct quantitative analysis. The framework can reconcile the documented price dispersion across firms and markets, while maintaining consistency with cross-sectional observations on firm productivity, markups, and sales. We estimate the model's parameters to match bilateral trade flows across 66 countries as well as moments from the markup and sales distributions of Chilean firms. The model reconciles both micro and macro facts quantitatively, and yields trade elasticity estimates that are in line with the existing literature. Hence, we conclude that the GCES model constitutes a plausible and parsimonious quantitative workhorse framework that can be used to analyze gains from trade.</p>

<p><strong>Ownership Structure and Productivity of Multinationals</strong></p>
<p>Çağatay Bircan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We examine the ownership structure and productivity of multinational affiliates and their effects on domestic industry. We first separate plant-level efficiency into a physical productivity and a price component. Multinationals target plants with high prices and markups. Upon acquisition they raise physical productivity but lower prices, leaving markups unchanged, especially when they are majority owners. This pro-competitive effect means that multinationals' productivity effects may be previously under-estimated. Multinational presence in an industry increases physical productivity while lowering prices at domestic firms, especially when majority-owned affiliates are present. Ownership structure and foreign acquisitions therefore play an important role in driving aggregate productivity growth.</p>

<p><strong>The effects of government spending on real exchange rates: Evidence from military spending panel data</strong></p>
<p>Wataru Miyamoto&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuy Lan Nguyen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viacheslav Sheremirov&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using panel data on military spending for 125 countries, we document new facts about the effects of changes in government purchases on the real exchange rate, consumption, and current accounts in both advanced and developing countries. While an increase in government purchases causes real exchange rates to appreciate and increases consumption significantly in developing countries, it causes real exchange rates to depreciate and decreases consumption in advanced countries. The current account decreases in both groups of countries. These findings are not consistent with standard international business cycle models. We discuss potential sources of the differences between advanced and developing countries in the responses to spending shocks.</p>

<p><strong>When do fixed exchange rates work? Evidence from the Gold Standard</strong></p>
<p>Yao Chen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felix Ward&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current account reversals under the Gold Standard (1880–1913) – a fixed exchange rate regime – were accompanied by few, if any, output losses. To understand why, we build and estimate an open economy model of the Gold Standard, which allows us to quantitatively assess the importance of three channels of external adjustment: flexible prices, international migration, and monetary policy. Our first finding is that flexible prices were the most influential channel through which output was stabilized, whereas migration and monetary policy mattered little. Our second finding is that price flexibility was predicated on large primary sectors. Their flexibly priced products dominated the export booms that stabilized output during major external adjustments.</p>

<p><strong>The interconnections between services and goods trade at the firm-level</strong></p>
<p>Andrea Ariu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holger Breinlich&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory Corcos&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giordano Mion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this paper we study how international trade in goods and services interact at the firm level. Using a rich dataset on Belgian firms for the period 1995–2005, we show that: i) firms are much more likely to source services and goods inputs from the same origin country rather than from different ones; ii) joint imports are associated with higher firm productivity; iii) increases in barriers to imports of goods reduce firm-level imports of services from the same market, and conversely. We build upon a discrete-choice model of goods and services input sourcing that can reproduce these facts to guide our econometric strategy. We use our results to quantify the impact of reductions in goods and services barriers between the US and the EU. Our findings have important implications for the design of trade policy. They suggest that a liberalization of services trade can have direct and sizable effects on goods trade, and vice versa. Moreover, liberalizing goods and services trade jointly brings substantial complementarities.</p>

<p><strong>Information frictions and real exchange rate dynamics</strong></p>
<p>Giacomo Candian&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real exchange rates are highly volatile and persistent. I provide a novel structural explanation for these facts using a model with dispersed information among firms. When producers face strategic complementarities in price-setting, uncertainty about competitors' beliefs results in sluggish price adjustment that can generate large and long-lived real exchange rate movements. I estimate the model using data from the US and Euro Area, and show that it successfully explains the unconditional volatility and persistence of the real exchange rate. The model also accounts for the persistent and hump-shaped real exchange rate behavior conditional on nominal disturbances documented by a structural VAR. About 50% of this persistence is due to the inertial dynamics of higher-order beliefs.</p>

<p><strong>On the widely differing effects of free trade agreements: Lessons from twenty years of trade integration</strong></p>
<p>Scott L. Baier&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoto Yotov&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas Zylkin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We develop a novel two stage methodology that allows us to study the empirical determinants of the ex post effects of past free trade agreements (FTAs) as well as obtain ex ante predictions for the effects of future FTAs. We first identify 908 unique estimates of the effects of FTAs on different trading pairs for the years 1986–2006. We then employ these estimates as our dependent variable in a “second stage” analysis characterizing the heterogeneity in these effects. Interestingly, most of this heterogeneity (∼2/3) occurs within FTAs (rather than across different FTAs), with asymmetric effects within pairs (on exports vs. imports) also playing an important role. Our second stage analysis provides several intuitive explanations behind these variations. Even within the same agreement, FTA effects are weaker for more distant pairs and for pairs with otherwise high levels of ex ante trade frictions. The effects of new FTAs are similarly weaker for pairs with existing agreements already in place. In addition, we are able to relate asymmetries in FTA effects to each country's ability to influence the other's terms of trade. Out-of-sample predictions incorporating these insights enable us to predict direction-specific effects of future FTAs between any pair of countries. A simulation of the general equilibrium effects of TTIP demonstrates the significance of our methods.</p>
