<p><strong>Scaling up sanitation: Evidence from an RCT in Indonesia</strong></p>
<p>Lisa Cameron&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susan Olivia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manisha Shah&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We investigate the impacts of a widely used sanitation intervention, Community-Led Total Sanitation, which was implemented at scale across rural areas of Indonesia with a randomized controlled trial to evaluate its effectiveness. The program resulted in modest increases in toilet construction, decreased community tolerance of open defecation and reduced roundworm infestations in children. However, there was no impact on anemia, height or weight. We find important heterogeneity along three dimensions: (1) poverty—poorer households are limited in their ability to improve sanitation; (2) implementer identity—scale up involves local governments taking over implementation from World Bank contractors yet no sanitation and health benefits accrue in villages with local government implementation; and (3) initial levels of social capital—villages with high initial social capital built toilets whereas the community-led approach was counterproductive in low social capital villages with fewer toilets being built.</p>

<p><strong>Irrigation dams, water and infant mortality: Evidence from South Africa</strong></p>
<p>Elizabeth Mettetal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irrigation dams enable farmers to harness substantial water resources. However, their use consumes finite water supplies and recycles agricultural water pollutants back into river systems. This paper examines the net effect of irrigation dams on infant mortality in South Africa. It relies on both fixed effects and instrumental variables approaches to counteract potential bias associated with non-random dam placement, with the latter approach predicting dam placement based on geographic features and policy changes. The analysis reveals that additional irrigation dams within South Africa's former homeland districts after Apartheid increased infant mortality by 10–20 percent. I then discuss and evaluate possible channels. Dam-induced increases in agricultural activity could increase water pollution and reduce water availability, and I provide supporting evidence that both channels may contribute. These results suggest a potential trade-off between the health costs of agricultural water use and the economic benefits of increased agricultural production.</p>

<p><strong>Do children benefit from internet access? Experimental evidence from Peru</strong></p>
<p>Ofer Malamud&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santiago Cueto&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julian Cristia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diether W. Beuermann&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper provides experimental evidence for the impact of home internet access on a broad range of child outcomes in Peru. We compare children who were randomly chosen to receive laptops with high-speed internet access to (i) those who did not receive laptops and (ii) those who only received laptops without internet. We find that providing free internet access led to improved computer and internet proficiency relative to those without laptops and improved internet proficiency compared to those with laptops only. However, there were no significant effects of internet access on math and reading achievement, cognitive skills, self-esteem, teacher perceptions, or school grades when compared to either group. We explore reasons for the absence of impacts on these key outcomes with survey questions, time-diaries, and computer logs.</p>

<p><strong>The internet and Chinese exports in the pre-ali baba era</strong></p>
<p>Ana M. Fernandes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaditya Mattoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huy Nguyen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marc Schiffbauer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dramatic expansion of internet access in China allows us to analyze the impact of the internet on firm performance. Combining firm-level production data with province-level information on internet penetration, we examine how the internet rollout across Chinese provinces in 1999–2007 influenced firm export behavior. We show that the internet rollout boosted firm manufacturing exports, even before the rise of major e-commerce platforms. We take a closer look at why, addressing three questions: what aspects of firm performance were affected, what types of firm communication were facilitated, and what dimensions of the new communication medium were relevant? We find that the internet did not just enhance trade but improved overall firm performance; results are consistent with improvements in communication with both buyers and input suppliers; benefits arose not just from better communication but from establishing a visible virtual presence, and were enhanced by, but not contingent on, access to broadband.</p>

<p><strong>Heterogeneous impact dynamics of a rural business development program in Nicaragua</strong></p>
<p>Michael R. Carter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia Tjernström&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patricia Toledo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We study the impacts of a rural development program designed to boost the income of the small-farm sector in Nicaragua. Exploiting the random assignment of treatment, we find statistically and economically significant impacts on gross farm income and investment in productive farm capital. Using continuous treatment estimation techniques, we examine the evolution of program impacts over time and find that the estimated income increase persists and that the impacts on productive capital stock continue to rise even after the program concluded. Additionally, panel quantile methods reveal striking heterogeneity of program impacts on both income and investment. We show that this heterogeneity is not random and that there appear to exist low-performing household types who benefit little from the program, whereas high-performing (upper quantile) households benefit more substantially. Analysis using generalized random forests, a machine learning algorithm, points toward greater program impacts for households who were disadvantaged at baseline. Even after controlling for this source of heterogeneity, we find large and persistent differences in how much different types of households benefited from the program. While the benefit-cost ratio of the program is on average positive, the impact heterogeneity suggests that business development programs aiming to engage farm households as agricultural entrepreneurs have limitations as instruments to eliminate rural poverty.</p>

<p><strong>The long-term impact of international migration on economic decision-making: Evidence from a migration lottery and lab-in-the-field experiments</strong></p>
<p>John Gibson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David McKenzie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halahingano Rohorua&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven Stillman&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We study how migrating from a poor country to a rich country affects economic beliefs, preference parameters, and household decision-making efficiency. In a ten-year follow-up survey of applicants to a migration lottery program we elicit risk and time preferences and pro-market beliefs for the migrants and the unsuccessful applicants. The successful and the unsuccessful applicants are each linked to closest relative households, who would stay in the home country if the applicant moved, to play lab-in-the-field games that measure intra-family trust and the efficiency of intra-family decision-making. Despite the large permanent income shock from migrating, there are no significant impacts on risk and time preferences, pro-market beliefs, or decision-making efficiency of transnational households. This stability in the face of such a large and life-changing event lend credence to economic models of migration that treat these determinants of decision-making as time-invariant.</p>

<p><strong>Workfare and infant health: Evidence from India's public works program</strong></p>
<p>A.V. Chari&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Glick&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward Okeke&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinduja V. Srinivasan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper examines the relationship between maternal employment and infant health in the context of a large workfare program that explicitly prioritizes female participation, India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Using multiple estimation strategies including a triple difference strategy that exploits a discontinuity in program eligibility at age 18, we find that the program had negative impacts on newborn infant survival, increasing newborn mortality among women who were eligible to participate in the program.</p>

<p><strong>Communal land and agricultural productivity</strong></p>
<p>Charles Gottlieb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jan Grobovšek&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communal land tenure is prevalent across many developing countries. It implements a “use it or lose it” principle that allows owners to farm their land but restricts their right to transfer it away. This paper measures the distortionary impact of communal land in a dynamic general equilibrium model of occupational selection, calibrated to Ethiopia. We find that lifting communal land tenure increases GDP by 9% and lowers agricultural employment by 18 percentage points. While agricultural productivity increases, that of non-agriculture drops. Communal land tenure rationalizes about one-half of the relative agricultural productivity gap in the poorest economies. Its impact on aggregate productivity, though, is comparatively minor.</p>

<p><strong>The new economic case for migration restrictions: An assessment</strong></p>
<p>Michael A. Clemens&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lant Pritchett&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Migration barriers tend to reduce global production by impeding efficient spatial reallocation of labor. Recent research argues for a countervailing effect of barriers, tending to raise global production by preventing the spread of impoverishing institutions from poor to rich countries. While evidence of this mechanism is scarce, it is theoretically plausible at high migration rates. We propose and calibrate a simple model of dynamically efficient migration when migrants spread economic institutions between countries. The net effect of migration depends on three parameters: transmission, the degree to which origin-country total factor productivity is embodied in migrants; assimilation, the degree to which migrants' productivity determinants become like natives' over time in the host country; and congestion, the degree to which transmission and assimilation change at higher migrant stocks. On current evidence about the magnitudes of these parameters, dynamically efficient policy would not imply open borders but would imply relaxation of current restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>Compulsory voting and TV news consumption</strong></p>
<p>Raphael Bruce&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafael Costa Lima&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do people acquire more information when they are encouraged to participate in elections? This paper presents empirical evidence on the effects of compulsory voting laws on the consumption of TV news. In Brazil, literate citizens over the age of eighteen are subject to a number of legal penalties if they fail to turn out on election day. This allows us to identify the causal effect of being under a compulsory voting regime on information acquisition. We find that compulsory voting has a significant and substantial positive impact on the probability of an individual to watch Brazil's main TV newscast. Additionally, the effect is stronger for individuals with neutral evaluations of the incumbent president. Our regression discontinuity results are restricted to young voters who just turned eighteen and are robust to different polynomials and bandwidth lengths.</p>

<p><strong>Women as decision makers in community forest management: Evidence from Nepal</strong></p>
<p>Marinella Leone&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many developing countries women are responsible for the collection and management of forest products essential to the daily lives of their household. However, women are often neglected in the decision-making process within community level institutions devoted to the management of natural resources. This paper looks at whether and how an increased participation of women in the Executive Committee (EC) of Community Forest User Groups (FUG) in Nepal affects forest protection. I exploit an amendment made to the guidelines for FUG formation that sets a higher threshold for women representation in the EC, to evaluate the impact of women on firewood extraction. The results show that higher female participation in the ECs of FUGs leads to a significant decrease in firewood extraction. These results suggest that in countries with common property resources, the effectiveness of collective action institutions depends also on their gender composition.</p>

<p><strong>Banking crises and exports: Lessons from the past</strong></p>
<p>Leonardo Iacovone&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esteban Ferro&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pereira-López, Mariana&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veronika Zavacka&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper analyzes the impact of banking crises on manufacturing exports, exploiting the fact that sectors differ in their needs for external financing. Relying on data from 160 developed and developing countries during 1970–2012, we analyze 147 banking crisis episodes and separate their impact on export growth from the impact of other exogenous shocks (e.g., demand shocks, exchange rate shocks). Our findings show that during a crisis, the exports of sectors more dependent on external finance grow significantly less than other sectors. However, this result holds only for sectors that depend on banking finance as opposed to interfirm finance (i.e., trade finance or trade credit). For sectors that depend heavily on banking finance, the effect of banking crises on exports is robust, additional to external demand shocks, and not driven by exchange rate shocks.</p>

<p><strong>Do asset transfers build household resilience?</strong></p>
<p>Lokendra Phadera&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope Michelson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter-Nelson, Alex&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Goldsmith&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate the impact of an asset transfer program on household resilience. We measure resilience as the probability that a household will sustain at least the threshold asset level required to support consumption above the poverty line. Using six rounds of data collected over 42 months in rural Zambia, we construct a measure of resilience based on households' conditional welfare distributions to estimate program impacts. We find that the program increased household resilience; beneficiaries' likelihood of being non-poor in future periods increased by 44%. The program both increased mean assets and decreased variance, signaling an upward shift in households’ conditional asset distributions. Our method demonstrates the added value of the resilience estimation compared with a conventional impact assessment; numerous households classified as non-poor are unlikely to remain non-poor over time and the relationship between wealth and resilience is driven by changes in both the conditional mean and the conditional variance.</p>

<p><strong>The shifting natural wealth of nations: The role of market orientation</strong></p>
<p>Rabah Arezki&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frederick van der Ploeg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frederik Toscani&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper explores the effect of market orientation on (known or available) natural resource wealth using a novel dataset of world-wide major hydrocarbon and mineral discoveries. Our empirical estimates based on a large panel of countries show that increased market orientation causes a significant increase in discoveries of natural resources. In a thought experiment where economies in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa remain closed, they would have only achieved one quarter of the actual increase in discoveries they have experienced since the early 1990s. Our results call into question the commonly held view that known or available natural resource endowments are exogenous.</p>

<p><strong>Wealth and inequality over eight centuries of British capitalism</strong></p>
<p>Jakob B. Madsen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper constructs annual data for the wealth-income ratio, W-Y, for the UK over the period 1210–2013. It is found that the W-Y ratio has fluctuated at one-two century frequencies about a constant level of approximately 500% over the past eight centuries. Furthermore, a U-shaped W-Y path is identified over the past two centuries and it is argued that the descending part of the U-shape is driven by the transition from pre-industrial modes of production to industrialization and that the post-1980 upturn in the W-Y ratio represents the transition from the industrial to the post-industrialization era.</p>

<p><strong>State-community property-rights sharing in forests and its contributions to environmental outcomes: Evidence from Thailand's community forestry</strong></p>
<p>Thanyaporn Chankrajang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper investigates impacts of assigning greater property rights in common-pool natural resources to local communities on environmental outcomes. Based on the forest-level dataset constructed by the GIS technique, the paper utilises the variation in forest property-rights sharing between the communities and the state, across 1197 reserve forests in Thailand from 2000 to 2017. It finds that under the instrumental variables strategy, forests with more extensive community forestry are significantly more likely to have proportionately greater area of forest cover and lesser fire incidence and intensity. Although the impact extends to the reduction of fires in the neighbouring agricultural area, it exacerbates fires experienced by the nearby open and non-excludable national parks. Measured at the station level, it is not suggestive that the community forestry's contributions to environmental outcomes have extended to the reduction of air pollution at the macro-level, as proxied by hazardous level of PM10.</p>

<p><strong>Vertical FDI and exchange rates over the business cycle: The welfare implications of openness to FDI</strong></p>
<p>Jiao Shi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has long been observed that a country tends to receive increased net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow when its currency depreciates. We build an open-economy macroeconomic model that accounts for the positive correlation, and re-examine the welfare implications of FDI, focusing mainly on the short run. We show that short-run FDI fluctuations exacerbate utility loss over business cycles in an environment with monetary shocks, but have little impact on welfare over business cycles caused by productivity shocks. The best outcome occurs when the economy retains long-run FDI, but restricts short-run movements in the production location of firms.</p>

<p><strong>Income timing and liquidity constraints: Evidence from a randomized field experiment</strong></p>
<p>Lasse Brune&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason T. Kerwin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in developing countries sometimes desire deferred income streams, which replace more-frequent income flows with a single, later lump sum. We study the effects of short-term wage deferral using a randomized experiment with participants in a temporary cash-for-work program. Workers who are assigned to lump-sum payments are five percentage points more likely to purchase a high-return investment. We discuss the role of both barriers to saving and credit constraints in explaining our results. While stated preferences for deferred payments suggest a role for savings constraints, the evidence is also consistent with a simpler model of credit constraints alone.</p>
